<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The Hans Andersen Fairy Tales will be read
in schools and homes as long as there are children
who love to read. As a story-teller for children the
author has no rival in power to enlist the imagination
and carry it along natural, healthful lines.
The power of his tales to charm and elevate runs
like a living thread through whatever he writes.
In the two books in which they are here presented
they have met the tests and held an undiminishing
popularity among the best children's books.
They are recognized as standards, and as juvenile
writings come to be more carefully standardized,
their place in permanent literature will grow
wider and more secure. A few children's authors
will be ranked among the Immortals, and Hans
Andersen is one of them.</p>

<p>Denmark and Finland supplied the natural
background for the quaint fancies and growing
genius of their gifted son, who was story-teller,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>playwright, and poet in one. Love of nature, love
of country, fellow-feeling with life in everything,
and a wonderful gift for investing everything with
life wrought together to produce in him a character
whose spell is in all his writings. "The Story
of My Life" is perhaps the most thrilling of all of
them. Recognized in courts of kings and castles
of nobles, he recited his little stories with the same
simplicity by which he had made them familiar
in cottages of the peasantry, and endeared himself
alike to all who listened. These attributes, while
they do not account for his genius, help us to unravel
the charm of it. The simplest of the stories
meet Ruskin's requirement for a child's story&mdash;they
are sweet and sad.</p>

<p>From most writers who have contributed largely
to children's literature only a few selected gems
are likely to gain permanence. With Andersen the
case is different. While there are such gems, the
greater value lies in taking these stories as a type
of literature and living in it a while, through the
power of cumulative reading. It is not too much
to say that there is a temper and spirit in Andersen
which is all his own&mdash;a simple philosophy
which continuous reading is sure to impart. For
this reason these are good books for a child to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>own; an occasional re-reading will inspire in him
a healthy, normal taste in reading. Many of the
stories are of value to read to very young children.
They guide an exuberant imagination along natural
channels.</p>

<p>The text of the present edition is a reprint of
an earlier one which was based upon a sentence-by-sentence
comparison of the four or five translations
current in Europe and America. It has been
widely commended as enjoyable reading, while
faithful to the letter and spirit of the Danish
original. A slight abridgment has been made in
two of the longer stories. The order of the selections
adapts the reading to the growing child&mdash;the
First Series should be sufficiently easy for
children of about eight or nine years old.</p>

<h2>HANS ANDERSEN'S FAIRY TALES</h2>




<h2>THE FIR TREE</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 71px;">
<img src="images/drop-f.png" width="71" height="100" alt="F" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>AR away in the forest, where the warm sun
and the fresh air made a sweet resting
place, grew a pretty little fir tree. The
situation was all that could be desired; and yet
the tree was not happy, it wished so much to be
like its tall companions, the pines and firs which
grew around it.</div>

<p>The sun shone, and the soft air fluttered its
leaves, and the little peasant children passed by,
prattling merrily; but the fir tree did not heed
them.</p>

<p>Sometimes the children would bring a large
basket of raspberries or strawberries, wreathed on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
straws, and seat themselves near the fir tree, and
say, "Is it not a pretty little tree?" which made
it feel even more unhappy than before.</p>

<p>And yet all this while the tree grew a notch or
joint taller every year, for by the number of joints
in the stem of a fir tree we can discover its age.</p>

<p>Still, as it grew, it complained: "Oh! how I wish
I were as tall as the other trees; then I would
spread out my branches on every side, and my
crown would overlook the wide world around. I
should have the birds building their nests on my
boughs, and when the wind blew, I should bow
with stately dignity, like my tall companions."</p>

<p>So discontented was the tree, that it took no
pleasure in the warm sunshine, the birds, or the
rosy clouds that floated over it morning and
evening.</p>

<p>Sometimes in winter, when the snow lay white
and glittering on the ground, there was a little
hare that would come springing along, and jump
right over the little tree's head; then how mortified
it would feel.</p>

<p>Two winters passed; and when the third
arrived, the tree had grown so tall that the hare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
was obliged to run round it. Yet it remained
unsatisfied and would exclaim: "Oh! to grow, to
grow; if I could but keep on growing tall and
old! There is nothing else worth caring for in
the world."</p>

<p>In the autumn the woodcutters came, as usual,
and cut down several of the tallest trees; and the
young fir, which was now grown to a good, full
height, shuddered as the noble trees fell to the
earth with a crash.</p>

<p>After the branches were lopped off, the trunks
looked so slender and bare that they could
scarcely be recognized. Then they were placed,
one upon another, upon wagons and drawn by
horses out of the forest. Where could they be
going? What would become of them? The
young fir tree wished very much to know.</p>

<p>So in the spring, when the swallows and the
storks came, it asked: "Do you know where
those trees were taken? Did you meet them?"</p>

<p>The swallows knew nothing; but the stork,
after a little reflection, nodded his head and
said: "Yes, I think I do. As I flew from Egypt,
I met several new ships, and they had fine masts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
that smelt like fir. These must have been the
trees; and I assure you they were stately; they
sailed right gloriously!"</p>

<p>"Oh, how I wish I were tall enough to go on
the sea," said the fir tree. "Tell me what is this
sea, and what does it look like?"</p>

<p>"It would take too much time to explain&mdash;a
great deal too much," said the stork, flying
quickly away.</p>

<p>"Rejoice in thy youth," said the sunbeam;
"rejoice in thy fresh growth and in the young
life that is in thee."</p>

<p>And the wind kissed the tree, and the dew
watered it with tears, but the fir tree regarded
them not.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Christmas time drew near, and many young
trees were cut down, some that were even smaller
and younger than the fir tree, who enjoyed neither
rest nor peace for longing to leave its forest
home. These young trees, which were chosen for
their beauty, kept their branches, and they, also,
were laid on wagons and drawn by horses far
away out of the forest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where are they going?" asked the fir tree.
"They are not taller than I am; indeed, one is
not so tall. And why do they keep all their
branches? Where are they going?"</p>

<p>"We know, we know," sang the sparrows;
"we have looked in at the windows of the
houses in the town, and we know what is done
with them. Oh! you cannot think what honor
and glory they receive. They are dressed up in
the most splendid manner. We have seen them
standing in the middle of a warm room, and
adorned with all sorts of beautiful things&mdash;honey
cakes, gilded apples, playthings, and many
hundreds of wax tapers."</p>

<p>"And then," asked the fir tree, trembling in all
its branches, "and then what happens?"</p>

<p>"We did not see any more," said the sparrows;
"but this was enough for us."</p>

<p>"I wonder whether anything so brilliant will
ever happen to me," thought the fir tree. "It
would be better even than crossing the sea. I
long for it almost with pain. Oh, when will
Christmas be here? I am now as tall and well
grown as those which were taken away last year.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
O that I were now laid on the wagon, or standing
in the warm room with all that brightness
and splendor around me! Something better and
more beautiful is to come after, or the trees
would not be so decked out. Yes, what follows
will be grander and more splendid. What can
it be? I am weary with longing. I scarcely
know what it is that I feel."</p>

<p>"Rejoice in our love," said the air and the
sunlight. "Enjoy thine own bright life in the
fresh air."</p>

<p>But the tree would not rejoice, though it grew
taller every day, and winter and summer its dark-green
foliage might be seen in the forest, while
passers-by would say, "What a beautiful tree!"</p>

<p>A short time before the next Christmas the
discontented fir tree was the first to fall. As
the ax cut sharply through the stem and divided
the pith, the tree fell with a groan to the earth,
conscious of pain and faintness and forgetting
all its dreams of happiness in sorrow at leaving
its home in the forest. It knew that it should
never again see its dear old companions the
trees, nor the little bushes and many-colored<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
flowers that had grown by its side; perhaps not
even the birds. Nor was the journey at all
pleasant.</p>

<p>The tree first recovered itself while being unpacked
in the courtyard of a house, with several
other trees; and it heard a man say: "We only
want one, and this is the prettiest. This is
beautiful!"</p>

<p>Then came two servants in grand livery and
carried the fir tree into a large and beautiful
apartment. Pictures hung on the walls, and near
the tall tile stove stood great china vases with
lions on the lids. There were rocking-chairs,
silken sofas, and large tables covered with pictures;
and there were books, and playthings that
had cost a hundred times a hundred dollars&mdash;at
least so said the children.</p>

<p>Then the fir tree was placed in a large tub
full of sand&mdash;but green baize hung all round it
so that no one could know it was a tub&mdash;and
it stood on a very handsome carpet. Oh, how the
fir tree trembled! What was going to happen
to him now? Some young ladies came, and the
servants helped them to adorn the tree.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>On one branch they hung little bags cut out
of colored paper, and each bag was filled with
sweetmeats. From other branches hung gilded
apples and walnuts, as if they had grown there;
and above and all around were hundreds of red,
blue, and white tapers, which were fastened upon
the branches. Dolls, exactly like real men and
women, were placed under the green leaves,&mdash;the
tree had never seen such things before,&mdash;and
at the very top was fastened a glittering star
made of gold tinsel. Oh, it was very beautiful.
"This evening," they all exclaimed, "how bright
it will be!"</p>

<p>"O that the evening were come," thought the
tree, "and the tapers lighted! Then I shall know
what else is going to happen. Will the trees of
the forest come to see me? Will the sparrows
peep in at the windows, I wonder, as they fly?
Shall I grow faster here than in the forest, and
shall I keep on all these ornaments during summer
and winter?" But guessing was of very
little use. His back ached with trying, and this
pain is as bad for a slender fir tree as headache
is for us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the tapers were lighted, and then what
a glistening blaze of splendor the tree presented!
It trembled so with joy in all its branches that
one of the candles fell among the green leaves
and burned some of them. "Help! help!" exclaimed
the young ladies; but no harm was done,
for they quickly extinguished the fire.</p>

<p>After this the tree tried not to tremble at all,
though the fire frightened him, he was so anxious
not to hurt any of the beautiful ornaments, even
while their brilliancy dazzled him.</p>

<p>And now the folding doors were thrown open,
and a troop of children rushed in as if they intended
to upset the tree, and were followed more
slowly by their elders. For a moment the little
ones stood silent with astonishment, and then
they shouted for joy till the room rang; and
they danced merrily round the tree while one
present after another was taken from it.</p>

<p>"What are they doing? What will happen
next?" thought the tree. At last the candles
burned down to the branches and were put out.
Then the children received permission to plunder
the tree.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, how they rushed upon it! There was such
a riot that the branches cracked, and had it not
been fastened with the glistening star to the
ceiling, it must have been thrown down.</p>

<p>Then the children danced about with their
pretty toys, and no one noticed the tree except
the children's maid, who came and peeped among
the branches to see if an apple or a fig had been
forgotten.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"A story, a story," cried the children, pulling
a little fat man towards the tree.</p>

<p>"Now we shall be in the green shade," said
the man as he seated himself under it, "and the
tree will have the pleasure of hearing, also; but
I shall only relate one story. What shall it be?
Ivede-Avede or Humpty Dumpty, who fell downstairs,
but soon got up again, and at last married
a princess?"</p>

<p>"Ivede-Avede," cried some; "Humpty Dumpty,"
cried others; and there was a famous uproar.
But the fir tree remained quite still and thought
to himself: "Shall I have anything to do with
all this? Ought I to make a noise, too?" but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
he had already amused them as much as they
wished and they paid no attention to him.</p>

<p>Then the old man told them the story of
Humpty Dumpty&mdash;how he fell downstairs, and
was raised up again, and married a princess.
And the children clapped their hands and cried,
"Tell another, tell another," for they wanted to
hear the story of Ivede-Avede; but this time they
had only "Humpty Dumpty." After this the fir
tree became quite silent and thoughtful. Never
had the birds in the forest told such tales as that
of Humpty Dumpty, who fell downstairs, and yet
married a princess.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! so it happens in the world," thought
the fir tree. He believed it all, because it was
related by such a pleasant man.</p>

<p>"Ah, well!" he thought, "who knows? Perhaps
I may fall down, too, and marry a princess;"
and he looked forward joyfully to the
next evening, expecting to be again decked out
with lights and playthings, gold and fruit. "To-morrow
I will not tremble," thought he; "I will
enjoy all my splendor, and I shall hear the
story of Humpty Dumpty again, and perhaps of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Ivede-Avede." And the tree remained quiet and
thoughtful all night.</p>

<p>In the morning the servants and the housemaid
came in. "Now," thought the fir tree, "all
my splendor is going to begin again." But they
dragged him out of the room and upstairs to the
garret and threw him on the floor in a dark
corner where no daylight shone, and there they
left him. "What does this mean?" thought the
tree. "What am I to do here? I can hear
nothing in a place like this;" and he leaned
against the wall and thought and thought.</p>

<p>And he had time enough to think, for days
and nights passed and no one came near him;
and when at last somebody did come, it was only
to push away some large boxes in a corner. So
the tree was completely hidden from sight, as if
it had never existed.</p>

<img src="images/p013i.png" width="336" height="500" alt="Threw him on the floor ..... and there they left him." title="" />
</div>

<p>"It is winter now," thought the tree; "the
ground is hard and covered with snow, so that
people cannot plant me. I shall be sheltered here,
I dare say, until spring comes. How thoughtful
and kind everybody is to me! Still, I wish this
place were not so dark and so dreadfully lonely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
with not even a little hare to look at. How
pleasant it was out in the forest while the snow
lay on the ground, when the hare would run by,
yes, and jump over me, too, although I did not
like it then. Oh! it is terribly lonely here."</p>

<p>"Squeak, squeak," said a little mouse, creeping
cautiously towards the tree; then came another,
and they both sniffed at the fir tree and crept
in and out between the branches.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is very cold," said the little mouse.
"If it were not we should be very comfortable
here, shouldn't we, old fir tree?"</p>

<p>"I am not old," said the fir tree. "There are
many who are older than I am."</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?" asked the mice,
who were full of curiosity; "and what do you
know? Have you seen the most beautiful places
in the world, and can you tell us all about them?
And have you been in the storeroom, where
cheeses lie on the shelf and hams hang from
the ceiling? One can run about on tallow candles
there; one can go in thin and come out fat."</p>

<p>"I know nothing of that," said the fir tree,
"but I know the wood, where the sun shines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and the birds sing." And then the tree told the
little mice all about its youth. They had never
heard such an account in their lives; and after
they had listened to it attentively, they said:
"What a number of things you have seen! You
must have been very happy."</p>

<p>"Happy!" exclaimed the fir tree; and then, as
he reflected on what he had been telling them, he
said, "Ah, yes! after all, those were happy days."
But when he went on and related all about
Christmas Eve, and how he had been dressed
up with cakes and lights, the mice said, "How
happy you must have been, you old fir tree."</p>

<p>"I am not old at all," replied the tree; "I
only came from the forest this winter. I am
now checked in my growth."</p>

<p>"What splendid stories you can tell," said the
little mice. And the next night four other mice
came with them to hear what the tree had to
tell. The more he talked the more he remembered,
and then he thought to himself: "Yes,
those were happy days; but they may come
again. Humpty Dumpty fell downstairs, and yet
he married the princess. Perhaps I may marry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a princess, too." And the fir tree thought of the
pretty little birch tree that grew in the forest; a
real princess, a beautiful princess, she was to him.</p>

<p>"Who is Humpty Dumpty?" asked the little
mice. And then the tree related the whole story;
he could remember every single word. And the
little mice were so delighted with it that they
were ready to jump to the top of the tree. The
next night a great many more mice made their
appearance, and on Sunday two rats came with
them; but the rats said it was not a pretty story
at all, and the little mice were very sorry, for it
made them also think less of it.</p>

<p>"Do you know only that one story?" asked
the rats.</p>

<p>"Only that one," replied the fir tree. "I heard
it on the happiest evening in my life; but I did
not know I was so happy at the time."</p>

<p>"We think it is a very miserable story," said
the rats. "Don't you know any story about
bacon or tallow in the storeroom?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the tree.</p>

<p>"Many thanks to you, then," replied the rats,
and they went their ways.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>The little mice also kept away after this, and
the tree sighed and said: "It was very pleasant
when the merry little mice sat round me and
listened while I talked. Now that is all past, too.
However, I shall consider myself happy when
some one comes to take me out of this place."</p>

<p>But would this ever happen? Yes; one
morning people came to clear up the garret;
the boxes were packed away, and the tree was
pulled out of the corner and thrown roughly
on the floor; then the servants dragged it out
upon the staircase, where the daylight shone.</p>

<p>"Now life is beginning again," said the tree,
rejoicing in the sunshine and fresh air. Then
it was carried downstairs and taken into the
courtyard so quickly that it forgot to think of
itself and could only look about, there was so
much to be seen.</p>

<p>The court was close to a garden, where everything
looked blooming. Fresh and fragrant roses
hung over the little palings. The linden trees
were in blossom, while swallows flew here and
there, crying, "Twit, twit, twit, my mate is coming";
but it was not the fir tree they meant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now I shall live," cried the tree joyfully,
spreading out its branches; but alas! they were
all withered and yellow, and it lay in a corner
among weeds and nettles. The star of gold
paper still stuck in the top of the tree and
glittered in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Two of the merry children who had danced
round the tree at Christmas and had been so
happy were playing in the same courtyard. The
youngest saw the gilded star and ran and pulled
it off the tree. "Look what is sticking to the
ugly old fir tree," said the child, treading on the
branches till they crackled under his boots.</p>

<p>And the tree saw all the fresh, bright flowers
in the garden and then looked at itself and
wished it had remained in the dark corner of
the garret. It thought of its fresh youth in the
forest, of the merry Christmas evening, and of
the little mice who had listened to the story of
Humpty Dumpty.</p>

<p>"Past! past!" said the poor tree. "Oh, had I
but enjoyed myself while I could have done so!
but now it is too late."</p>

<p>Then a lad came and chopped the tree into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
small pieces, till a large bundle lay in a heap
on the ground. The pieces were placed in a fire,
and they quickly blazed up brightly, while the
tree sighed so deeply that each sigh was like a
little pistol shot. Then the children who were
at play came and seated themselves in front of
the fire, and looked at it and cried, "Pop, pop."
But at each "pop," which was a deep sigh, the
tree was thinking of a summer day in the forest
or of some winter night there when the stars
shone brightly, and of Christmas evening, and
of Humpty Dumpty,&mdash;the only story it had ever
heard or knew how to relate,&mdash;till at last it
was consumed.</p>

<p>The boys still played in the garden, and the
youngest wore on his breast the golden star
with which the tree had been adorned during
the happiest evening of its existence. Now all
was past; the tree's life was past and the story
also past&mdash;for all stories must come to an end
at some time or other.</p>

<h2>LITTLE TUK</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 84px;">
<img src="images/drop-l.png" width="84" height="100" alt="L" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>ITTLE TUK! An odd name, to be sure!
However, it was not the little boy's real
name. His real name was Carl; but when
he was so young that he could not speak plainly,
he used to call himself Tuk. It would be hard to
say why, for it is not at all like "Carl"; but the
name does as well as any, if one only knows it.</div>

<p>Little Tuk was left at home to take care of
his sister Gustava, who was much younger than
himself; and he had also to learn his lesson.
Here were two things to be done at the same
time, and they did not at all suit each other.
The poor boy sat with his sister in his lap, singing
to her all the songs he knew, yet giving,
now and then, a glance into his geography, which
lay open beside him. By to-morrow morning he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
must know the names of all the towns in Seeland
by heart, and be able to tell about them all that
could be told.</p>

<p>His mother came at last, and took little Gustava
in her arms. Tuk ran quickly to the window
and read and read till he had almost read
his eyes out&mdash;for it was growing dark, and his
mother could not afford to buy candles.</p>

<p>"There goes the old washerwoman down the
lane," said the mother, as she looked out of the
window. "She can hardly drag herself along,
poor thing; and now she has to carry that heavy
pail from the pump. Be a good boy, little Tuk,
and run across to help the poor creature, will
you not?" And little Tuk ran quickly and
helped to bear the weight of the pail. But when
he came back into the room, it was quite dark.
Nothing was said about a candle, and it was of
no use to wish for one; he must go to his little
trundle-bed, which was made of an old settle.</p>

<p>There he lay, still thinking of the geography
lesson, of Seeland, and of all that the master
had said. He could not read the book again,
as he should by rights have done, for want of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
a light. So he put the geography-book under
his pillow. Somebody had once told him that
would help him wonderfully to remember his
lesson, but he had never yet found that one
could depend upon it.</p>

<p>There he lay and thought and thought, till
all at once he felt as though some one were
gently sealing his mouth and eyes with a kiss.
He slept and yet did not sleep, for he seemed
to see the old washerwoman's mild, kind eyes
fixed upon him, and to hear her say: "It would
be a shame, indeed, for you not to know your lesson
to-morrow, little Tuk. You helped me; now
I will help you, and our Lord will help us both."</p>

<p>All at once the leaves of the book began to
rustle under little Tuk's head, and he heard something
crawling about under his pillow.</p>

<p>"Cluck, cluck, cluck!" cried a hen, as she crept
towards him. (She came from the town of Kj&ouml;ge.)
"I'm a Kj&ouml;ge hen," she said. And then she told
him how many inhabitants the little town contained,
and about the battle that had once been
fought there, and how it was now hardly worth
mentioning, there were so many greater things.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/p023i.png" width="339" height="500" alt="All in a moment he was on horseback, and on he went, gallop, gallop!" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Scratch, scratch! kribbley crabbley! and now
a great wooden bird jumped down upon the bed.
It was the popinjay from the shooting ground at
Pr&aelig;st&ouml;. He had reckoned the number of inhabitants
in Pr&aelig;st&ouml;, and found that there were as
many as he had nails in his body. He was a
proud bird. "Thorwaldsen lived in one corner
of Pr&aelig;st&ouml;, close by me. Am I not a pretty bird,
a merry popinjay?"</p>

<p>And now little Tuk no longer lay in bed. All
in a moment he was on horseback, and on he
went, gallop, gallop! A splendid knight, with a
bright helmet and waving plume,&mdash;a knight of
the olden time,&mdash;held him on his own horse;
and on they rode together, through the wood of
the ancient city of Vordingborg, and it was once
again a great and busy town. The high towers
of the king's castle rose against the sky, and
bright lights were seen gleaming through the
windows. Within were music and merrymaking.
King Waldemar was leading out the noble ladies
of his court to dance with him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the morning dawned, the lamps grew
pale, the sun rose, the outlines of the buildings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
faded away, and at last one high tower alone
remained to mark the spot where the royal castle
had stood. The vast city had shrunk into a poor,
mean-looking little town. The schoolboys, coming
out of school with their geography-books under
their arms, said, "Two thousand inhabitants";
but that was a mere boast, for the town had
not nearly so many.</p>

<p>And little Tuk lay in his bed. He knew not
whether he had been dreaming or not, but again
there was some one close by his side.</p>

<p>"Little Tuk! little Tuk!" cried a voice; it
was the voice of a young sailor boy. "I am
come to bring you greeting from Kors&ouml;r. Kors&ouml;r
is a new town, a living town, with steamers
and mail coaches. Once people used to call it a
low, ugly place, but they do so no longer.</p>

<p>"'I dwell by the seaside,' says Kors&ouml;r; 'I have
broad highroads and pleasure gardens; and I
have given birth to a poet, a witty one, too,
which is more than all poets are. I once thought
of sending a ship all round the world; but I did
not do it, though I might as well have done
so. I dwell so pleasantly, close by the port; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
I am fragrant with perfume, for the loveliest roses
bloom round about me, close to my gates.'"</p>

<p>And little Tuk could smell the roses and see
them and their fresh green leaves. But in a moment
they had vanished; the green leaves spread
and thickened&mdash;a perfect grove had grown up
above the bright waters of the bay, and above
the grove rose the two high-pointed towers of a
glorious old church. From the side of the grass-grown
hill gushed a fountain in rainbow-hued
streams, with a merry, musical voice, and close
beside it sat a king, wearing a gold crown upon
his long dark hair. This was King Hroar of
the springs; and hard by was the town of Roskilde
(Hroar's Fountain). And up the hill, on
a broad highway, went all the kings and queens
of Denmark, wearing golden crowns; hand in
hand they passed on into the church, and the
deep music of the organ mingled with the clear
rippling of the fountain. For nearly all the
kings and queens of Denmark lie buried in this
beautiful church. And little Tuk saw and heard
it all.</p>

<p>"Don't forget the towns," said King Hroar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Then all vanished; though where it went he
knew not. It seemed like turning the leaves of
a book.</p>

<p>And now there stood before him an old peasant
woman from Sor&ouml;, the quiet little town
where grass grows in the very market place.
Her green linen apron was thrown over her head
and back, and the apron was very wet, as if it
had been raining heavily.</p>

<p>"And so it has," she said. And she told a
great many pretty things from Holberg's comedies,
and recited ballads about Waldemar and
Absalon; for Holberg had founded an academy
in her native town.</p>

<p>All at once she cowered down and rocked her
head as if she were a frog about to spring.
"Koax!" cried she; "it is wet, it is always wet,
and it is as still as the grave in Sor&ouml;." She
had changed into a frog. "Koax!" and again
she was an old woman. "One must dress according
to the weather," she said.</p>

<p>"It is wet! it is wet! My native town is like a
bottle; one goes in at the cork, and by the cork
one must come out. In old times we had the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
finest of fish; now we have fresh, rosy-cheeked
boys at the bottom of the bottle. There they learn
wisdom&mdash;Greek, Greek, and Hebrew! Koax!"</p>

<p>It sounded exactly as if frogs were croaking, or
as if some one were walking over the great swamp
with heavy boots. So tiresome was her tone, all
on the same note, that little Tuk fell fast asleep;
and a very good thing it was for him.</p>

<p>But even in sleep there came a dream, or whatever
else it may be called. His little sister Gustava,
with her blue eyes and flaxen ringlets, was grown
into a tall, beautiful girl, who, though she had no
wings, could fly; and away they now flew over
Seeland&mdash;over its green woods and blue waters.</p>

<p>"Hark! Do you hear the cock crow, little Tuk?
'Cock-a-doodle-do!' The fowls are flying hither
from Kj&ouml;ge, and you shall have a farmyard, a
great, great poultry yard of your own! You shall
never suffer hunger or want. The golden goose,
the bird of good omen, shall be yours; you shall
become a rich and happy man. Your house shall
rise up like King Waldemar's towers and be richly
decked with statues like those of Thorwaldsen
at Pr&aelig;st&ouml;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Understand me well; your good name shall be
borne round the world, like the ship that was to
sail from Kors&ouml;r, and at Roskilde you shall speak
and give counsel wisely and well, little Tuk, like
King Hroar; and when at last you shall lie in
your peaceful grave you shall sleep as quietly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As if I lay sleeping in Sor&ouml;," said Tuk, and
he woke. It was a bright morning, and he could
not remember his dream, but it was not necessary
that he should. One has no need to know what
one will live to see.</p>

<p>And now he sprang quickly out of bed and
sought his book, that had lain under his pillow.
He read his lesson and found that he knew the
towns perfectly well.</p>

<p>And the old washerwoman put her head in at
the door and said, with a friendly nod: "Thank
you, my good child, for yesterday's help. May
the Lord fulfill your brightest and most beautiful
dreams! I know he will."</p>

<p>Little Tuk had forgotten what he had dreamed,
but it did not matter. There was One above who
knew it all.</p>

<h2>THE UGLY DUCKLING</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 38px;"><img src="images/drop-i.png" width="38" height="100" alt="I" title="" /></div><div class='unindent'>T was so beautiful in the country. It was the
summer time. The wheat fields were golden,
the oats were green, and the hay stood in
great stacks in the green meadows. The stork
paraded about among them on his long red legs,
chattering away in Egyptian, the language he
had learned from his lady mother.</div>

<p>All around the meadows and cornfields grew
thick woods, and in the midst of the forest was a
deep lake. Yes, it was beautiful, it was delightful
in the country.</p>

<p>In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farmhouse
circled all about with deep canals; and
from the walls down to the water's edge grew
great burdocks, so high that under the tallest of
them a little child might stand upright. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
spot was as wild as if it had been in the very
center of the thick wood.</p>

<p>In this snug retreat sat a duck upon her nest,
watching for her young brood to hatch; but the
pleasure she had felt at first was almost gone;
she had begun to think it a wearisome task, for
the little ones were so long coming out of their
shells, and she seldom had visitors. The other
ducks liked much better to swim about in the
canals than to climb the slippery banks and sit
under the burdock leaves to have a gossip with her.
It was a long time to stay so much by herself.</p>

<p>At length, however, one shell cracked, and soon
another, and from each came a living creature
that lifted its head and cried "Peep, peep."</p>

<p>"Quack, quack!" said the mother; and then
they all tried to say it, too, as well as they could,
while they looked all about them on every side at
the tall green leaves. Their mother allowed them
to look about as much as they liked, because
green is good for the eyes.</p>

<p>"What a great world it is, to be sure," said the
little ones, when they found how much more room
they had than when they were in the eggshell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is this all the world, do you imagine?" said
the mother. "Wait till you have seen the garden.
Far beyond that it stretches down to the
pastor's field, though I have never ventured to
such a distance. Are you all out?" she continued,
rising to look. "No, not all; the largest egg lies
there yet, I declare. I wonder how long this
business is to last. I'm really beginning to be
tired of it;" but for all that she sat down again.</p>

<p>"Well, and how are you to-day?" quacked an
old duck who came to pay her a visit.</p>

<p>"There's one egg that takes a deal of hatching.
The shell is hard and will not break," said
the fond mother, who sat still upon her nest.
"But just look at the others. Have I not a
pretty family? Are they not the prettiest little
ducklings you ever saw? They are the image
of their father&mdash;the good for naught! He never
comes to see me."</p>

<p>"Let me see the egg that will not break,"
said the old duck. "I've no doubt it's a Guinea
fowl's egg. The same thing happened to me
once, and a deal of trouble it gave me, for the
young ones are afraid of the water. I quacked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and clucked, but all to no purpose. Let me take
a look at it. Yes, I am right; it's a Guinea fowl,
upon my word; so take my advice and leave it
where it is. Come to the water and teach the
other children to swim."</p>

<p>"I think I will sit a little while longer," said
the mother. "I have sat so long, a day or two
more won't matter."</p>

<p>"Very well, please yourself," said the old duck,
rising; and she went away.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>At last the great egg broke, and the latest bird
cried "Peep, peep," as he crept forth from the
shell. How big and ugly he was! The mother
duck stared at him and did not know what to
think. "Really," she said, "this is an enormous
duckling, and it is not at all like any of the
others. I wonder if he will turn out to be a
Guinea fowl. Well, we shall see when we get to
the water&mdash;for into the water he must go, even
if I have to push him in myself."</p>

<p>On the next day the weather was delightful.
The sun shone brightly on the green burdock
leaves, and the mother duck took her whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
family down to the water and jumped in with a
splash. "Quack, quack!" cried she, and one after
another the little ducklings jumped in. The water
closed over their heads, but they came up again
in an instant and swam about quite prettily,
with their legs paddling under them as easily as
possible; their legs went of their own accord;
and the ugly gray-coat was also in the water,
swimming with them.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the mother, "that is not a Guinea
fowl. See how well he uses his legs, and how
erect he holds himself! He is my own child, and
he is not so very ugly after all, if you look at
him properly. Quack, quack! come with me now.
I will take you into grand society and introduce
you to the farmyard, but you must keep close to
me or you may be trodden upon; and, above all,
beware of the cat."</p>

<p>When they reached the farmyard, there was a
wretched riot going on; two families were fighting
for an eel's head, which, after all, was carried
off by the cat. "See, children, that is the way
of the world," said the mother duck, whetting her
beak, for she would have liked the eel's head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
herself. "Come, now, use your legs, and let me
see how well you can behave. You must bow
your heads prettily to that old duck yonder; she
is the highest born of them all and has Spanish
blood; therefore she is well off. Don't you see
she has a red rag tied to her leg, which is something
very grand and a great honor for a duck;
it shows that every one is anxious not to lose
her, and that she is to be noticed by both man
and beast. Come, now, don't turn in your toes; a
well-bred duckling spreads his feet wide apart,
just like his father and mother, in this way;
now bend your necks and say 'Quack!'"</p>

<p>The ducklings did as they were bade, but the
other ducks stared, and said, "Look, here comes
another brood&mdash;as if there were not enough of
us already! And bless me, what a queer-looking
object one of them is; we don't want him here";
and then one flew out and bit him in the neck.</p>

<p>"Let him alone," said the mother; "he is not
doing any harm."</p>

<p>"Yes, but he is so big and ugly. He's a perfect
fright," said the spiteful duck, "and therefore he must
be turned out. A little biting will do him good."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"The others are very pretty children," said the
old duck with the rag on her leg, "all but that
one. I wish his mother could smooth him up a
bit; he is really ill-favored."</p>

<p>"That is impossible, your grace," replied the
mother. "He is not pretty, but he has a very
good disposition and swims as well as the others
or even better. I think he will grow up pretty,
and perhaps be smaller. He has remained too
long in the egg, and therefore his figure is not
properly formed;" and then she stroked his neck
and smoothed the feathers, saying: "It is a drake,
and therefore not of so much consequence. I
think he will grow up strong and able to take
care of himself."</p>

<p>"The other ducklings are graceful enough,"
said the old duck. "Now make yourself at
home, and if you find an eel's head you can
bring it to me."</p>

<p>And so they made themselves comfortable;
but the poor duckling who had crept out of his
shell last of all and looked so ugly was bitten
and pushed and made fun of, not only by the
ducks but by all the poultry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;">
<img src="images/p037i.png" width="333" height="500" alt="Bless me, what a queer-looking object one of them is..." title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is too big," they all said; and the turkey
cock, who had been born into the world with
spurs and fancied himself really an emperor,
puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail and
flew at the duckling. He became quite red in
the head with passion, so that the poor little
thing did not know where to go, and was quite
miserable because he was so ugly as to be laughed
at by the whole farmyard.</p>

<p>So it went on from day to day; it got worse
and worse. The poor duckling was driven about
by every one; even his brothers and sisters were
unkind to him and would say, "Ah, you ugly
creature, I wish the cat would get you" and
his mother had been heard to say she wished he
had never been born. The ducks pecked him,
the chickens beat him, and the girl who fed the
poultry pushed him with her feet. So at last
he ran away, frightening the little birds in the
hedge as he flew over the palings. "They are
afraid because I am so ugly," he said. So he flew
still farther, until he came out on a large moor
inhabited by wild ducks. Here he remained the
whole night, feeling very sorrowful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning, when the wild ducks rose in
the air, they stared at their new comrade. "What
sort of a duck are you?" they all said, coming
round him.</p>

<p>He bowed to them and was as polite as he
could be, but he did not reply to their question.
"You are exceedingly ugly," said the wild ducks;
"but that will not matter if you do not want to
marry one of our family."</p>

<p>Poor thing! he had no thoughts of marriage;
all he wanted was permission to lie among the
rushes and drink some of the water on the moor.
After he had been on the moor two days, there
came two wild geese, or rather goslings, for they
had not been out of the egg long, which accounts
for their impertinence. "Listen, friend," said one
of them to the duckling; "you are so ugly that
we like you very well. Will you go with us and
become a bird of passage? Not far from here
is another moor, in which there are some wild
geese, all of them unmarried. It is a chance for
you to get a wife. You may make your fortune,
ugly as you are."</p>

<p>"Bang, bang," sounded in the air, and the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
wild geese fell dead among the rushes, and the
water was tinged with blood. "Bang, bang,"
echoed far and wide in the distance, and whole
flocks of wild geese rose up from the rushes.</p>

<p>The sound continued from every direction, for
the sportsmen surrounded the moor, and some
were even seated on branches of trees, overlooking
the rushes. The blue smoke from the guns
rose like clouds over the dark trees, and as it
floated away across the water, a number of sporting
dogs bounded in among the rushes, which
bent beneath them wherever they went. How
they terrified the poor duckling! He turned
away his head to hide it under his wing, and at
the same moment a large, terrible dog passed
quite near him. His jaws were open, his tongue
hung from his mouth, and his eyes glared fearfully.
He thrust his nose close to the duckling,
showing his sharp teeth, and then "splash, splash,"
he went into the water, without touching him.</p>

<p>"Oh," sighed the duckling, "how thankful I am
for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me."</p>

<p>And so he lay quite still, while the shot rattled
through the rushes, and gun after gun was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
fired over him. It was late in the day before
all became quiet, but even then the poor young
thing did not dare to move. He waited quietly
for several hours and then, after looking carefully
around him, hastened away from the moor
as fast as he could. He ran over field and
meadow till a storm arose, and he could hardly
struggle against it.</p>

<p>Towards evening he reached a poor little cottage
that seemed ready to fall, and only seemed
to remain standing because it could not decide
on which side to fall first. The storm continued
so violent that the duckling could go no farther.
He sat down by the cottage, and then he noticed
that the door was not quite closed, in consequence
of one of the hinges having given way. There
was, therefore, a narrow opening near the bottom
large enough for him to slip through, which
he did very quietly, and got a shelter for the
night. Here, in this cottage, lived a woman, a
cat, and a hen. The cat, whom his mistress
called "My little son," was a great favorite; he
could raise his back, and purr, and could even
throw out sparks from his fur if it were stroked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the wrong way. The hen had very short legs,
so she was called "Chickie Short-legs." She laid
good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she
had been her own child. In the morning the
strange visitor was discovered; the cat began to
purr and the hen to cluck.</p>

<p>"What is that noise about?" said the old
woman, looking around the room. But her sight
was not very good; therefore when she saw the
duckling she thought it must be a fat duck that
had strayed from home. "Oh, what a prize!"
she exclaimed. "I hope it is not a drake, for
then I shall have some ducks' eggs. I must wait
and see."</p>

<p>So the duckling was allowed to remain on trial
for three weeks; but there were no eggs.</p>

<p>Now the cat was the master of the house, and
the hen was the mistress; and they always said,
"We and the world," for they believed themselves
to be half the world, and by far the
better half, too. The duckling thought that
others might hold a different opinion on the
subject, but the hen would not listen to such
doubts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can you lay eggs?" she asked. "No."
"Then have the goodness to cease talking."
"Can you raise your back, or purr, or throw out
sparks?" said the cat. "No." "Then you have
no right to express an opinion when sensible
people are speaking." So the duckling sat in a
corner, feeling very low-spirited; but when the
sunshine and the fresh air came into the room
through the open door, he began to feel such
a great longing for a swim that he could not
help speaking of it.</p>

<p>"What an absurd idea!" said the hen. "You
have nothing else to do; therefore you have foolish
fancies. If you could purr or lay eggs, they
would pass away."</p>

<p>"But it is so delightful to swim about on the
water," said the duckling, "and so refreshing to
feel it close over your head while you dive down
to the bottom."</p>

<p>"Delightful, indeed! it must be a queer sort
of pleasure," said the hen. "Why, you must be
crazy! Ask the cat&mdash;he is the cleverest animal
I know; ask him how he would like to swim about
on the water, or to dive under it, for I will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
speak of my own opinion. Ask our mistress, the
old woman; there is no one in the world more
clever than she is. Do you think she would relish
swimming and letting the water close over her
head?"</p>

<p>"I see you don't understand me," said the
duckling.</p>

<p>"We don't understand you? Who can understand
you, I wonder? Do you consider yourself
more clever than the cat or the old woman?&mdash;I
will say nothing of myself. Don't imagine such
nonsense, child, and thank your good fortune that
you have been so well received here. Are you not
in a warm room and in society from which you
may learn something? But you are a chatterer,
and your company is not very agreeable. Believe
me, I speak only for your good. I may tell you
unpleasant truths, but that is a proof of my friendship.
I advise you, therefore, to lay eggs and
learn to purr as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>"I believe I must go out into the world again,"
said the duckling.</p>

<p>"Yes, do," said the hen. So the duckling left
the cottage and soon found water on which it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
could swim and dive, but he was avoided by all
other animals because of his ugly appearance.</p>

<p>Autumn came, and the leaves in the forest
turned to orange and gold; then, as winter approached,
the wind caught them as they fell and
whirled them into the cold air. The clouds, heavy
with hail and snowflakes, hung low in the sky,
and the raven stood among the reeds, crying,
"Croak, croak." It made one shiver with cold to
look at him. All this was very sad for the poor
little duckling.</p>

<p>One evening, just as the sun was setting amid
radiant clouds, there came a large flock of beautiful
birds out of the bushes. The duckling had
never seen any like them before. They were
swans; and they curved their graceful necks,
while their soft plumage shone with dazzling
whiteness. They uttered a singular cry as they
spread their glorious wings and flew away from
those cold regions to warmer countries across
the sea. They mounted higher and higher in the
air, and the ugly little duckling had a strange
sensation as he watched them. He whirled himself
in the water like a wheel, stretched out his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
neck towards them, and uttered a cry so strange
that it frightened even himself. Could he ever
forget those beautiful, happy birds! And when
at last they were out of his sight, he dived under
the water and rose again almost beside himself
with excitement. He knew not the names of
these birds nor where they had flown, but he
felt towards them as he had never felt towards
any other bird in the world.</p>

<p>He was not envious of these beautiful creatures;
it never occurred to him to wish to be as lovely
as they. Poor ugly creature, how gladly he would
have lived even with the ducks, had they only
treated him kindly and given him encouragement.</p>

<p>The winter grew colder and colder; he was
obliged to swim about on the water to keep it
from freezing, but every night the space on
which he swam became smaller and smaller. At
length it froze so hard that the ice in the water
crackled as he moved, and the duckling had to
paddle with his legs as well as he could, to
keep the space from closing up. He became
exhausted at last and lay still and helpless, frozen
fast in the ice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in the morning a peasant who was passing
by saw what had happened. He broke the
ice in pieces with his wooden shoe and carried
the duckling home to his wife. The warmth
revived the poor little creature; but when the
children wanted to play with him, the duckling
thought they would do him some harm, so he
started up in terror, fluttered into the milk pan,
and splashed the milk about the room. Then the
woman clapped her hands, which frightened him
still more. He flew first into the butter cask,
then into the meal tub and out again. What
a condition he was in! The woman screamed
and struck at him with the tongs; the children
laughed and screamed and tumbled over each
other in their efforts to catch him, but luckily
he escaped. The door stood open; the poor
creature could just manage to slip out among
the bushes and lie down quite exhausted in the
newly fallen snow.</p>

<p>It would be very sad were I to relate all the
misery and privations which the poor little duckling
endured during the hard winter; but when it
had passed he found himself lying one morning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
in a moor, amongst the rushes. He felt the
warm sun shining and heard the lark singing
and saw that all around was beautiful spring.</p>

<p>Then the young bird felt that his wings were
strong, as he flapped them against his sides and
rose high into the air. They bore him onwards
until, before he well knew how it had happened,
he found himself in a large garden. The apple
trees were in full blossom, and the fragrant elders
bent their long green branches down to the
stream, which wound round a smooth lawn.
Everything looked beautiful in the freshness of
early spring. From a thicket close by came three
beautiful white swans, rustling their feathers and
swimming lightly over the smooth water. The
duckling saw these lovely birds and felt more
strangely unhappy than ever.</p>

<p>"I will fly to these royal birds," he exclaimed,
"and they will kill me because, ugly as I am, I
dare to approach them. But it does not matter;
better be killed by them than pecked by the
ducks, beaten by the hens, pushed about by the
maiden who feeds the poultry, or starved with
hunger in the winter."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he flew to the water and swam towards
the beautiful swans. The moment they espied
the stranger they rushed to meet him with outstretched
wings.</p>

<p>"Kill me," said the poor bird and he bent
his head down to the surface of the water and
awaited death.</p>

<p>But what did he see in the clear stream below?
His own image&mdash;no longer a dark-gray bird, ugly
and disagreeable to look at, but a graceful and
beautiful swan.</p>

<p>To be born in a duck's nest in a farmyard is
of no consequence to a bird if it is hatched from
a swan's egg. He now felt glad at having suffered
sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him
to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness
around him; for the great swans swam
round the newcomer and stroked his neck with
their beaks, as a welcome.</p>

<p>Into the garden presently came some little children
and threw bread and cake into the water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 335px;">
<img src="images/p050i.png" width="335" height="500" alt="The new one is the most beautiful of all..." title="" />
</div>

<p>"See," cried the youngest, "there is a new
one;" and the rest were delighted, and ran to
their father and mother, dancing and clapping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
their hands and shouting joyously, "There is
another swan come; a new one has arrived."</p>

<p>Then they threw more bread and cake into
the water and said, "The new one is the most
beautiful of all, he is so young and pretty." And
the old swans bowed their heads before him.</p>

<p>Then he felt quite ashamed and hid his head
under his wing, for he did not know what to do,
he was so happy&mdash;yet he was not at all proud.
He had been persecuted and despised for his
ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the
most beautiful of all the birds. Even the elder
tree bent down its boughs into the water before
him, and the sun shone warm and bright. Then
he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck,
and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart,
"I never dreamed of such happiness as this while
I was the despised ugly duckling."</p>

<h2>LITTLE IDA'S FLOWERS</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 134px;"><img src="images/drop-mquote.png" width="134" height="100" alt="M" title="" /></div><div class='unindent'>Y POOR flowers are quite faded!"
said little Ida. "Only yesterday evening
they were so pretty, and now all
the leaves are drooping. Why do they do that?"
she asked of the student, who sat on the sofa.
He was a great favorite with her, because he used
to tell her the prettiest of stories and cut out
the most amusing things in paper&mdash;hearts with
little ladies dancing in them, and high castles
with doors which one could open and shut. He
was a merry student. "Why do the flowers look
so wretched to-day?" asked she again, showing
him a bouquet of faded flowers.</div>

<p>"Do you not know?" replied the student.
"The flowers went to a ball last night, and are
tired. That's why they hang their heads."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"What an idea," exclaimed little Ida. "Flowers
cannot dance!"</p>

<p>"Of course they can dance! When it is dark,
and we are all gone to bed, they jump about as
merrily as possible. They have a ball almost
every night."</p>

<p>"And can their children go to the ball?"
asked Ida.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said the student; "daisies and lilies
of the valley, that are quite little."</p>

<p>"And when is it that the prettiest flowers
dance?"</p>

<p>"Have you not been to the large garden outside
the town gate, in front of the castle where
the king lives in summer&mdash;the garden that is so
full of lovely flowers? You surely remember the
swans which come swimming up when you give
them crumbs of bread? Believe me, they have
capital balls there."</p>

<p>"I was out there only yesterday with my
mother," said Ida, "but there were no leaves on
the trees, and I did not see a single flower. What
has become of them? There were so many in
the summer."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are inside the palace now," replied the
student. "As soon as the king and all his court
go back to the town, the flowers hasten out of
the garden and into the palace, where they have
famous times. Oh, if you could but see them!
The two most beautiful roses seat themselves
on the throne and act king and queen. All the
tall red cockscombs stand before them on either
side and bow; they are the chamberlains. Then
all the pretty flowers come, and there is a great
ball. The blue violets represent the naval cadets;
they dance with hyacinths and crocuses, who take
the part of young ladies. The tulips and the tall
tiger lilies are old ladies,&mdash;dowagers,&mdash;who see
to it that the dancing is well done and that all
things go on properly."</p>

<p>"But," asked little Ida, "is there no one there
to harm the flowers for daring to dance in the
king's castle?"</p>

<p>"No one knows anything about it," replied the
student. "Once during the night, perhaps, the
old steward of the castle does, to be sure, come
in with his great bunch of keys to see that all
is right; but the moment the flowers hear the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
clanking of the keys they stand stock-still or hide
themselves behind the long silk window curtains.
Then the old steward will say, 'Do I not smell
flowers here?' but he can't see them."</p>

<p>"That is very funny," exclaimed little Ida,
clapping her hands with glee; "but should not
I be able to see the flowers?"</p>

<p>"To be sure you can see them," replied the
student. "You have only to remember to peep
in at the windows the next time you go to the
palace. I did so this very day, and saw a long yellow
lily lying on the sofa. She was a court lady."</p>

<p>"Do the flowers in the Botanical Garden go to
the ball? Can they go all that long distance?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the student; "for the flowers
can fly if they please. Have you not seen the
beautiful red and yellow butterflies that look so
much like flowers? They are in fact nothing else.
They have flown off their stalks high into the
air and flapped their little petals just as if they
were wings, and thus they came to fly about.
As a reward for always behaving well they have
leave to fly about in the daytime, too, instead of
sitting quietly on their stalks at home, till at last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the flower petals have become real wings. That
you have seen yourself.</p>

<p>"It may be, though, that the flowers in the
Botanical Garden have never been in the king's
castle. They may not have heard what frolics
take place there every night. But I'll tell you; if,
the next time you go to the garden, you whisper
to one of the flowers that a great ball is to be
given yonder in the castle, the news will spread
from flower to flower and they will all fly away.
Then should the professor come to his garden
there won't be a flower there, and he will not be
able to imagine what has become of them."</p>

<p>"But how can one flower tell it to another?
for I am sure the flowers cannot speak."</p>

<p>"No; you are right there," returned the student.
"They cannot speak, but they can make signs.
Have you ever noticed that when the wind blows
a little the flowers nod to each other and move
all their green leaves? They can make each other
understand in this way just as well as we do
by talking."</p>

<p>"And does the professor understand their
pantomime?" asked Ida.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, certainly; at least part of it. He came
into his garden one morning and saw that a
great stinging nettle was making signs with its
leaves to a beautiful red carnation. It was saying,
'You are so beautiful, and I love you with all my
heart!' But the professor doesn't like that sort
of thing, and he rapped the nettle on her leaves,
which are her fingers; but she stung him, and
since then he has never dared to touch a nettle."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed little Ida, "that is very
funny."</p>

<p>"How can one put such stuff into a child's
head?" said a tiresome councilor, who had come
to pay a visit. He did not like the student and
always used to scold when he saw him cutting
out the droll pasteboard figures, such as a man
hanging on a gibbet and holding a heart in his
hand to show that he was a stealer of hearts, or
an old witch riding on a broomstick and carrying
her husband on the end of her nose. The councilor
could not bear such jokes, and he would
always say, as now: "How can any one put such
notions into a child's head? They are only foolish
fancies."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>But to little Ida all that the student had told
her was very entertaining, and she kept thinking
it over. She was sure now that her pretty yesterday's
flowers hung their heads because they were
tired, and that they were tired because they had
been to the ball. So she took them to the table
where stood her toys. Her doll lay sleeping, but
Ida said to her, "You must get up, and be content
to sleep to-night in the table drawer, for the
poor flowers are ill and must have your bed to
sleep in; then perhaps they will be well again
by to-morrow."</p>

<p>And she at once took the doll out, though the
doll looked vexed at giving up her cradle to
the flowers.</p>

<p>Ida laid the flowers in the doll's bed and drew
the coverlet quite over them, telling them to lie
still while she made some tea for them to drink,
in order that they might be well next day. And
she drew the curtains about the bed, that the
sun might not shine into their eyes.</p>

<p>All the evening she thought of nothing but
what the student had told her; and when she
went to bed herself, she ran to the window where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
her mother's tulips and hyacinths stood. She
whispered to them, "I know very well that you
are going to a ball to-night." The flowers pretended
not to understand and did not stir so
much as a leaf, but that did not prevent Ida
from knowing what she knew.</p>

<p>When she was in bed she lay for a long time
thinking how delightful it must be to see the
flower dance in the king's castle, and said to
herself, "I wonder if my flowers have really been
there." Then she fell asleep.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the night she woke. She had been dreaming
of the student and the flowers and the councilor,
who told her they were making game of
her. All was still in the room, the night lamp
was burning on the table, and her father and
mother were both asleep.</p>

<p>"I wonder if my flowers are still lying in
Sophie's bed," she thought to herself. "How I
should like to know!" She raised herself a little
and looked towards the door, which stood half
open; within lay the flowers and all her playthings.
She listened, and it seemed to her that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
she heard some one playing upon the piano, but
quite softly, and more sweetly than she had ever
heard before.</p>

<p>"Now all the flowers are certainly dancing,"
thought she. "Oh, how I should like to see
them!" but she dared not get up for fear of
waking her father and mother. "If they would
only come in here!" But the flowers did not
come, and the music went on so prettily that
she could restrain herself no longer, and she
crept out of her little bed, stole softly to the
door, and peeped into the room. Oh, what a
pretty sight it was!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/p061i.png" width="337" height="500" alt="On the floor all the flowers danced gracefully...." title="" />
</div>

<p>There was no night lamp in the room, still it
was quite bright; the moon shone through the
window down upon the floor, and it was almost
like daylight. The hyacinths and tulips stood
there in two rows. Not one was left on the
window, where stood the empty flower pots. On
the floor all the flowers danced gracefully, making
all the turns, and holding each other by their
long green leaves as they twirled around. At the
piano sat a large yellow lily, which little Ida
remembered to have seen in the summer, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
she recollected that the student had said, "How
like she is to Miss Laura," and how every one
had laughed at the remark. But now she really
thought that the lily was very like the young
lady. It had exactly her manner of playing&mdash;bending
its long yellow face, now to one side and
now to the other, and nodding its head to mark
the time of the beautiful music.</p>

<p>A tall blue crocus now stepped forward, sprang
upon the table on which lay Ida's playthings,
went straight to the doll's cradle, and drew back
the curtains. There lay the sick flowers; but
they rose at once, greeted the other flowers, and
made a sign that they would like to join in the
dance. They did not look at all ill now.</p>

<p>Suddenly a heavy noise was heard, as of something
falling from the table. Ida glanced that
way and saw that it was the rod she had found
on her bed on Shrove Tuesday, and that it seemed
to wish to belong to the flowers. It was a pretty
rod, for a wax figure that looked exactly like the
councilor sat upon the head of it.</p>

<p>The rod began to dance, and the wax figure
that was riding on it became long and great, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the councilor himself, and began to exclaim,
"How can one put such stuff into a child's
head?" It was very funny to see, and little Ida
could not help laughing, for the rod kept on
dancing, and the councilor had to dance too,&mdash;there
was no help for it,&mdash;whether he remained
tall and big or became a little wax figure again.
But the other flowers said a good word for him,
especially those that had lain in the doll's bed,
so that at last the rod left it in peace.</p>

<p>At the same time there was a loud knocking
inside the drawer where Sophie, Ida's doll, lay
with many other toys. She put out her head and
asked in great astonishment: "Is there a ball
here? Why has no one told me of it?" She sat
down upon the table, expecting some of the
flowers to ask her to dance with them; but as
they did not, she let herself fall upon the floor so
as to make a great noise; and then the flowers
all came crowding about to ask if she were hurt,
and they were very polite&mdash;especially those that
had lain in her bed.</p>

<p>She was not at all hurt, and the flowers thanked
her for the use of her pretty bed and took her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
into the middle of the room, where the moon
shone, and danced with her, while the other
flowers formed a circle around them. So now
Sophie was pleased and said they might keep
her bed, for she did not mind sleeping in the
drawer the least in the world.</p>

<p>But the flowers replied: "We thank you most
heartily for your kindness, but we shall not live
long enough to need it; we shall be quite dead
by to-morrow. But tell little Ida she is to bury
us out in the garden near the canary bird's grave;
and then we shall wake again next summer and
be even more beautiful than we have been this
year."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you must not die," said Sophie, kissing
them as she spoke; and then a great company of
flowers came dancing in. Ida could not imagine
where they could have come from, unless from
the king's garden. Two beautiful roses led the
way, wearing golden crowns; then followed wallflowers
and pinks, who bowed to all present.
They brought a band of music with them. Wild
hyacinths and little white snowdrops jingled
merry bells. It was a most remarkable orchestra.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Following these were an immense number of
flowers, all dancing&mdash;violets, daisies, lilies of the
valley, and others which it was a delight to see.</p>

<p>At last all the happy flowers wished one
another good night. Little Ida, too, crept back
to bed, to dream of all that she had seen.</p>

<p>When she rose next morning she went at
once to her little table to see if her flowers were
there. She drew aside the curtains of her little
bed; yes, there lay the flowers, but they were
much more faded to-day than yesterday. Sophie
too was in the drawer, but she looked very
sleepy.</p>

<p>"Do you remember what you were to say to
me?" asked Ida of her.</p>

<p>But Sophie looked quite stupid and had not
a word to say.</p>

<p>"You are not kind at all," said Ida; "and yet
all the flowers let you dance with them."</p>

<p>Then she chose from her playthings a little
pasteboard box with birds painted on it, and in
it she laid the dead flowers.</p>

<p>"That shall be your pretty casket," said she;
"and when my cousins come to visit me, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and by, they shall help me to bury you in the
garden, in order that next summer you may grow
again and be still more beautiful."</p>

<p>The two cousins were two merry boys, Gustave
and Adolphe. Their father had given them each
a new crossbow, which they brought with them to
show to Ida. She told them of the poor flowers
that were dead and were to be buried in the
garden. So the two boys walked in front, with
their bows slung across their shoulders, and little
Ida followed, carrying the dead flowers in their
pretty coffin. A little grave was dug for them in
the garden. Ida first kissed the flowers and then
laid them in the earth, and Adolphe and Gustave
shot with their crossbows over the grave, for they
had neither guns nor cannons.</p>

<h2>THE STEADFAST TIN SOLDIER</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;"><img src="images/drop-t.png" width="83" height="100" alt="T" title="" /></div><div class='unindent'>HERE were once five and twenty tin soldiers.
They were brothers, for they had all
been made out of the same old tin spoon.
They all shouldered their bayonets, held themselves
upright, and looked straight before them.
Their uniforms were very smart-looking&mdash;red
and blue&mdash;and very splendid. The first thing
they heard in the world, when the lid was taken
off the box in which they lay, was the words "Tin
soldiers!" These words were spoken by a little
boy, who clapped his hands for joy. The soldiers
had been given him because it was his birthday,
and now he was putting them out upon the table.</div>

<p>Each was exactly like the rest to a hair, except
one who had but one leg. He had been cast last
of all, and there had not been quite enough tin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to finish him; but he stood as firmly upon his
one leg as the others upon their two, and it was
he whose fortunes became so remarkable.</p>

<p>On the table where the tin soldiers had been
set up were several other toys, but the one that
attracted most attention was a pretty little paper
castle. Through its tiny windows one could see
straight into the hall. In front of the castle stood
little trees, clustering round a small mirror which
was meant to represent a transparent lake. Swans
of wax swam upon its surface, and it reflected
back their images.</p>

<p>All this was very pretty, but prettiest of all
was a little lady who stood at the castle's open
door. She too was cut out of paper, but she
wore a frock of the clearest gauze and a narrow
blue ribbon over her shoulders, like a scarf, and
in the middle of the ribbon was placed a shining
tinsel rose. The little lady stretched out both
her arms, for she was a dancer, and then she
lifted one leg so high that the Soldier quite lost
sight of it. He thought that, like himself, she
had but one leg.</p>

<p>"That would be just the wife for me," thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
he, "if she were not too grand. But she lives in
a castle, while I have only a box, and there are
five and twenty of us in that. It would be no
place for a lady. Still, I must try to make her
acquaintance." A snuffbox happened to be upon
the table and he lay down at full length behind
it, and here he could easily watch the dainty
little lady, who still remained standing on one
leg without losing her balance.</p>

<p>When the evening came all the other tin soldiers
were put away in their box, and the people
in the house went to bed. Now the playthings
began to play in their turn. They visited, fought
battles, and gave balls. The tin soldiers rattled
in the box, for they wished to join the rest,
but they could not lift the lid. The nutcrackers
turned somersaults, and the pencil jumped about
in a most amusing way. There was such a din
that the canary woke and began to speak&mdash;and in
verse, too. The only ones who did not move from
their places were the Tin Soldier and the Lady
Dancer. She stood on tiptoe with outstretched
arms, and he was just as persevering on his one
leg; he never once turned away his eyes from her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Twelve o'clock struck&mdash;crash! up sprang the
lid of the snuffbox. There was no snuff in it,
but a little black goblin. You see it was not a
real snuffbox, but a jack-in-the-box.</p>

<p>"Tin Soldier," said the Goblin, "keep thine
eyes to thyself. Gaze not at what does not concern
thee!"</p>

<p>But the Tin Soldier pretended not to hear.</p>

<p>"Only wait, then, till to-morrow," remarked
the Goblin.</p>

<p>Next morning, when the children got up, the
Tin Soldier was placed on the window sill, and,
whether it was the Goblin or the wind that did
it, all at once the window flew open and the Tin
Soldier fell head foremost from the third story
to the street below. It was a tremendous fall!
Over and over he turned in the air, till at last he
rested, his cap and bayonet sticking fast between
the paving stones, while his one leg stood upright
in the air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/p071i.png" width="336" height="500" alt="Away he sailed ... down the gutter..." title="" />
</div>

<p>The maidservant and the little boy came down
at once to look for him, but, though they nearly
trod upon him, they could not manage to find
him. If the Soldier had but once called "Here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
am I!" they might easily enough have heard him,
but he did not think it becoming to cry out for
help, being in uniform.</p>

<p>It now began to rain; faster and faster fell the
drops, until there was a heavy shower; and when
it was over, two street boys came by.</p>

<p>"Look you," said one, "there lies a tin soldier.
He must come out and sail in a boat."</p>

<p>So they made a boat out of an old newspaper
and put the Tin Soldier in the middle of it, and
away he sailed down the gutter, while the boys
ran along by his side, clapping their hands.</p>

<p>Goodness! how the waves rocked that paper
boat, and how fast the stream ran! The Tin
Soldier became quite giddy, the boat veered round
so quickly; still he moved not a muscle, but
looked straight before him and held his bayonet
tightly.</p>

<p>All at once the boat passed into a drain, and
it became as dark as his own old home in the box.
"Where am I going now?" thought he. "Yes,
to be sure, it is all that Goblin's doing. Ah! if
the little lady were but sailing with me in the
boat, I would not care if it were twice as dark."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then a great water rat, that lived under
the drain, darted suddenly out.</p>

<p>"Have you a passport?" asked the rat.
"Where is your passport?"</p>

<p>But the Tin Soldier kept silence and only held
his bayonet with a firmer grasp.</p>

<p>The boat sailed on, but the rat followed.
Whew! how he gnashed his teeth and cried to
the sticks and straws: "Stop him! stop him! He
hasn't paid toll! He hasn't shown his passport!"</p>

<p>But the stream grew stronger and stronger.
Already the Tin Soldier could see daylight at
the point where the tunnel ended; but at the
same time he heard a rushing, roaring noise, at
which a bolder man might have trembled. Think!
just where the tunnel ended, the drain widened
into a great sheet that fell into the mouth of a
sewer. It was as perilous a situation for the Soldier
as sailing down a mighty waterfall would be
for us.</p>

<p>He was now so near it that he could not stop.
The boat dashed on, and the Tin Soldier held
himself so well that no one might say of him
that he so much as winked an eye. Three or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
four times the boat whirled round and round;
it was full of water to the brim and must certainly
sink.</p>

<p>The Tin Soldier stood up to his neck in water;
deeper and deeper sank the boat, softer and softer
grew the paper; and now the water closed over
the Soldier's head. He thought of the pretty
little dancer whom he should never see again,
and in his ears rang the words of the song:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Wild adventure, mortal danger,<br />
Be thy portion, valiant stranger.<br />
</div>

<p>The paper boat parted in the middle, and the
Soldier was about to sink, when he was swallowed
by a great fish.</p>

<p>Oh, how dark it was! darker even than in the
drain, and so narrow; but the Tin Soldier retained
his courage; there he lay at full length, shouldering
his bayonet as before.</p>

<p>To and fro swam the fish, turning and twisting
and making the strangest movements, till at last
he became perfectly still.</p>

<p>Something like a flash of daylight passed
through him, and a voice said, "Tin Soldier!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
The fish had been caught, taken to market, sold
and bought, and taken to the kitchen, where the
cook had cut him with a large knife. She seized
the Tin Soldier between her finger and thumb
and took him to the room where the family sat,
and where all were eager to see the celebrated
man who had traveled in the maw of a fish; but
the Tin Soldier remained unmoved. He was not
at all proud.</p>

<p>They set him upon the table there. But how
could so curious a thing happen? The Soldier
was in the very same room in which he had been
before. He saw the same children, the same toys
stood upon the table, and among them the pretty
dancing maiden, who still stood upon one leg.
She too was steadfast. That touched the Tin
Soldier's heart. He could have wept tin tears,
but that would not have been proper. He looked
at her and she looked at him, but neither spoke
a word.</p>

<p>And now one of the little boys took the Tin
Soldier and threw him into the stove. He gave
no reason for doing so, but no doubt the Goblin
in the snuffbox had something to do with it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The Tin Soldier stood now in a blaze of red
light. The heat he felt was terrible, but whether
it proceeded from the fire or from the love in his
heart, he did not know. He saw that the colors
were quite gone from his uniform, but whether
that had happened on the journey or had been
caused by grief, no one could say. He looked at
the little lady, she looked at him, and he felt himself
melting; still he stood firm as ever, with his
bayonet on his shoulder. Then suddenly the door
flew open; the wind caught the Dancer, and she
flew straight into the stove to the Tin Soldier,
flashed up in a flame, and was gone! The Tin
Soldier melted into a lump; and in the ashes the
maid found him next day, in the shape of a little
tin heart, while of the Dancer nothing remained
save the tinsel rose, and that was burned as black
as a coal.</p>

<h2>LITTLE THUMBELINA</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;"><img src="images/drop-t.png" width="83" height="100" alt="T" title="" /></div><div class='unindent'>HERE was once a woman who wished
very much to have a little child. She
went to a fairy and said: "I should so very
much like to have a little child. Can you tell me
where I can find one?"</div>

<p>"Oh, that can be easily managed," said the
fairy. "Here is a barleycorn; it is not exactly of
the same sort as those which grow in the farmers'
fields, and which the chickens eat. Put it into a
flowerpot and see what will happen."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the woman; and she gave
the fairy twelve shillings, which was the price of
the barleycorn. Then she went home and planted
it, and there grew up a large, handsome flower,
somewhat like a tulip in appearance, but with its
leaves tightly closed, as if it were still a bud.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a beautiful flower," said the woman,
and she kissed the red and golden-colored petals;
and as she did so the flower opened, and she
could see that it was a real tulip. But within
the flower, upon the green velvet stamens, sat a
very delicate and graceful little maiden. She was
scarcely half as long as a thumb, and they gave
her the name of Little Thumb, or Thumbelina,
because she was so small.</p>

<p>A walnut shell, elegantly polished, served her
for a cradle; her bed was formed of blue violet
leaves, with a rose leaf for a counterpane. Here
she slept at night, but during the day she amused
herself on a table, where the peasant wife had
placed a plate full of water.</p>

<p>Round this plate were wreaths of flowers with
their stems in the water, and upon it floated
a large tulip leaf, which served the little one
for a boat. Here she sat and rowed herself
from side to side, with two oars made of white
horsehair. It was a very pretty sight. Thumbelina
could also sing so softly and sweetly
that nothing like her singing had ever before
been heard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>One night, while she lay in her pretty bed, a
large, ugly, wet toad crept through a broken pane
of glass in the window and leaped right upon
the table where she lay sleeping under her rose-leaf
quilt.</p>

<p>"What a pretty little wife this would make for
my son," said the toad, and she took up the
walnut shell in which Thumbelina lay asleep,
and jumped through the window with it, into
the garden.</p>

<p>In the swampy margin of a broad stream in
the garden lived the toad with her son. He was
uglier even than his mother; and when he saw
the pretty little maiden in her elegant bed, he
could only cry "Croak, croak, croak."</p>

<p>"Don't speak so loud, or she will wake," said
the toad, "and then she might run away, for she
is as light as swan's-down. We will place her on
one of the water-lily leaves out in the stream; it
will be like an island to her, she is so light and
small, and then she cannot escape; and while
she is there we will make haste and prepare the
stateroom under the marsh, in which you are to
live when you are married."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Far out in the stream grew a number of water
lilies with broad green leaves which seemed to
float on the top of the water. The largest of
these leaves appeared farther off than the rest,
and the old toad swam out to it with the walnut
shell, in which Thumbelina still lay asleep.</p>

<p>The tiny creature woke very early in the morning
and began to cry bitterly when she found
where she was, for she could see nothing but
water on every side of the large green leaf, and
no way of reaching the land.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the old toad was very busy under
the marsh, decking her room with rushes and
yellow wildflowers, to make it look pretty for her
new daughter-in-law. Then she swam out with her
ugly son to the leaf on which she had placed poor
Thumbelina. She wanted to bring the pretty bed,
that she might put it in the bridal chamber to be
ready for her. The old toad bowed low to her in
the water and said, "Here is my son; he will be
your husband, and you will live happily together
in the marsh by the stream."</p>

<p>"Croak, croak, croak," was all her son could
say for himself. So the toad took up the elegant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
little bed and swam away with it, leaving Thumbelina
all alone on the green leaf, where she sat
and wept. She could not bear to think of living
with the old toad and having her ugly son for a
husband. The little fishes who swam about in
the water beneath had seen the toad and heard
what she said, so now they lifted their heads
above the water to look at the little maiden.</p>

<p>As soon as they caught sight of her they saw
she was very pretty, and it vexed them to think
that she must go and live with the ugly toads.</p>

<p>"No, it must never be!" So they gathered
together in the water, round the green stalk
which held the leaf on which the little maiden
stood, and gnawed it away at the root with their
teeth. Then the leaf floated down the stream, carrying
Thumbelina far away out of reach of land.</p>

<p>Thumbelina sailed past many towns, and the
little birds in the bushes saw her and sang,
"What a lovely little creature." So the leaf swam
away with her farther and farther, till it brought
her to other lands. A graceful little white butterfly
constantly fluttered round her and at last
alighted on the leaf. The little maiden pleased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
him, and she was glad of it, for now the toad could
not possibly reach her, and the country through
which she sailed was beautiful, and the sun shone
upon the water till it glittered like liquid gold.
She took off her girdle and tied one end of it
round the butterfly, fastening the other end of the
ribbon to the leaf, which now glided on much faster
than before, taking Thumbelina with it as she stood.</p>

<p>Presently a large cockchafer flew by. The moment
he caught sight of her he seized her round
her delicate waist with his claws and flew with
her into a tree. The green leaf floated away on
the brook, and the butterfly flew with it, for he
was fastened to it and could not get away.</p>

<p>Oh, how frightened Thumbelina felt when the
cockchafer flew with her to the tree! But especially
was she sorry for the beautiful white butterfly
which she had fastened to the leaf, for if he
could not free himself he would die of hunger.
But the cockchafer did not trouble himself at all
about the matter. He seated himself by her side,
on a large green leaf, gave her some honey from
the flowers to eat, and told her she was very
pretty, though not in the least like a cockchafer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/p083i.png" width="337" height="500" alt="Glided on much faster than before...." title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>After a time all the cockchafers who lived in
the tree came to pay Thumbelina a visit. They
stared at her, and then the young lady cockchafers
turned up their feelers and said, "She
has only two legs! how ugly that looks." "She
has no feelers," said another. "Her waist is quite
slim. Pooh! she is like a human being."</p>

<p>"Oh, she is ugly," said all the lady cockchafers.
The cockchafer who had run away with her believed
all the others when they said she was ugly.
He would have nothing more to say to her, and
told her she might go where she liked. Then he
flew down with her from the tree and placed her
on a daisy, and she wept at the thought that she
was so ugly that even the cockchafers would have
nothing to say to her. And all the while she was
really the loveliest creature that one could imagine,
and as tender and delicate as a beautiful
rose leaf.</p>

<p>During the whole summer poor little Thumbelina
lived quite alone in the wide forest. She
wove herself a bed with blades of grass and hung
it up under a broad leaf, to protect herself from
the rain. She sucked the honey from the flowers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
for food and drank the dew from their leaves
every morning.</p>

<p>So passed away the summer and the autumn,
and then came the winter&mdash;the long, cold winter.
All the birds who had sung to her so sweetly had
flown away, and the trees and the flowers had
withered. The large shamrock under the shelter
of which she had lived was now rolled together
and shriveled up; nothing remained but a yellow,
withered stalk. She felt dreadfully cold, for her
clothes were torn, and she was herself so frail and
delicate that she was nearly frozen to death. It
began to snow, too; and the snowflakes, as they
fell upon her, were like a whole shovelful falling
upon one of us, for we are tall, but she was only
an inch high. She wrapped herself in a dry leaf,
but it cracked in the middle and could not keep
her warm, and she shivered with cold.</p>

<p>Near the wood in which she had been living
was a large cornfield, but the corn had been
cut a long time; nothing remained but the
bare, dry stubble, standing up out of the frozen
ground. It was to her like struggling through
a large wood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh! how she shivered with the cold. She came
at last to the door of a field mouse, who had a
little den under the corn stubble. There dwelt
the field mouse in warmth and comfort, with a
whole roomful of corn, a kitchen, and a beautiful
dining room. Poor Thumbelina stood before the
door, just like a little beggar girl, and asked for
a small piece of barleycorn, for she had been
without a morsel to eat for two days.</p>

<p>"You poor little creature," said the field mouse,
for she was really a good old mouse, "come into
my warm room and dine with me."</p>

<p>She was pleased with Thumbelina, so she said,
"You are quite welcome to stay with me all the
winter, if you like; but you must keep my rooms
clean and neat, and tell me stories, for I shall like
to hear them very much." And Thumbelina did
all that the field mouse asked her, and found
herself very comfortable.</p>

<p>"We shall have a visitor soon," said the field
mouse one day; "my neighbor pays me a visit
once a week. He is better off than I am; he has
large rooms, and wears a beautiful black velvet
coat. If you could only have him for a husband,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
you would be well provided for indeed. But he
is blind, so you must tell him some of your prettiest
stories."</p>

<p>Thumbelina did not feel at all interested about
this neighbor, for he was a mole. However, he
came and paid his visit, dressed in his black
velvet coat.</p>

<p>"He is very rich and learned, and his house
is twenty times larger than mine," said the field
mouse.</p>

<p>He was rich and learned, no doubt, but he
always spoke slightingly of the sun and the
pretty flowers, because he had never seen them.
Thumbelina was obliged to sing to him, "Ladybird,
ladybird, fly away home," and many other
pretty songs. And the mole fell in love with her
because she had so sweet a voice; but he said
nothing yet, for he was very prudent and cautious.
A short time before, the mole had dug a long
passage under the earth, which led from the dwelling
of the field mouse to his own, and here she
had permission to walk with Thumbelina whenever
she liked. But he warned them not to be
alarmed at the sight of a dead bird which lay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in the passage. It was a perfect bird, with a
beak and feathers, and could not have been dead
long. It was lying just where the mole had made
his passage. The mole took in his mouth a piece
of phosphorescent wood, which glittered like fire
in the dark. Then he went before them to light
them through the long, dark passage. When they
came to the spot where the dead bird lay, the
mole pushed his broad nose through the ceiling,
so that the earth gave way and the daylight
shone into the passage.</p>

<p>In the middle of the floor lay a swallow, his
beautiful wings pulled close to his sides, his feet
and head drawn up under his feathers&mdash;the poor
bird had evidently died of the cold. It made
little Thumbelina very sad to see it, she did so
love the little birds; all the summer they had
sung and twittered for her so beautifully. But the
mole pushed it aside with his crooked legs and
said: "He will sing no more now. How miserable
it must be to be born a little bird! I am thankful
that none of my children will ever be birds,
for they can do nothing but cry 'Tweet, tweet,'
and must always die of hunger in the winter."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, you may well say that, as a clever man!"
exclaimed the field mouse. "What is the use of his
twittering if, when winter comes, he must either
starve or be frozen to death? Still, birds are very
high bred."</p>

<p>Thumbelina said nothing, but when the two
others had turned their backs upon the bird, she
stooped down and stroked aside the soft feathers
which covered his head, and kissed the closed
eyelids. "Perhaps this was the one who sang to
me so sweetly in the summer," she said; "and
how much pleasure it gave me, you dear, pretty
bird."</p>

<p>The mole now stopped up the hole through
which the daylight shone, and then accompanied
the ladies home. But during the night Thumbelina
could not sleep; so she got out of bed and
wove a large, beautiful carpet of hay. She carried
it to the dead bird and spread it over him, with
some down from the flowers which she had found
in the field mouse's room. It was as soft as wool,
and she spread some of it on each side of the
bird, so that he might lie warmly in the cold
earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Farewell, pretty little bird," said she, "farewell.
Thank you for your delightful singing
during the summer, when all the trees were
green and the warm sun shone upon us." Then
she laid her head on the bird's breast, but she
was alarmed, for it seemed as if something inside
the bird went "thump, thump." It was the bird's
heart; he was not really dead, only benumbed
with the cold, and the warmth had restored him
to life. In autumn all the swallows fly away into
warm countries; but if one happens to linger, the
cold seizes it, and it becomes chilled and falls
down as if dead. It remains where it fell, and
the cold snow covers it.</p>

<p>Thumbelina trembled very much; she was
quite frightened, for the bird was large, a great
deal larger than herself (she was only an inch
high). But she took courage, laid the wool more
thickly over the poor swallow, and then took a
leaf which she had used for her own counterpane
and laid it over his head.</p>

<p>The next night she again stole out to see him.
He was alive, but very weak; he could only open
his eyes for a moment to look at Thumbelina,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
who stood by, holding a piece of decayed wood in
her hand, for she had no other lantern. "Thank
you, pretty little maiden," said the sick swallow;
"I have been so nicely warmed that I shall soon
regain my strength and be able to fly about
again in the warm sunshine."</p>

<p>"Oh," said she, "it is cold out of doors now;
it snows and freezes. Stay in your warm bed;
I will take care of you."</p>

<p>She brought the swallow some water in a
flower leaf, and after he had drunk, he told her
that he had wounded one of his wings in a thornbush
and could not fly as fast as the others, who
were soon far away on their journey to warm
countries. At last he had fallen to the earth, and
could remember nothing more, nor how he came
to be where she had found him.</p>

<p>All winter the swallow remained underground,
and Thumbelina nursed him with care and love.
She did not tell either the mole or the field
mouse anything about it, for they did not like
swallows. Very soon the springtime came, and
the sun warmed the earth. Then the swallow
bade farewell to Thumbelina, and she opened the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
hole in the ceiling which the mole had made.
The sun shone in upon them so beautifully that
the swallow asked her if she would go with him.
She could sit on his back, he said, and he would
fly away with her into the green woods. But she
knew it would grieve the field mouse if she left
her in that manner, so she said, "No, I cannot."</p>

<p>"Farewell, then, farewell, you good, pretty
little maiden," said the swallow, and he flew out
into the sunshine.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Thumbelina looked after him, and the tears
rose in her eyes. She was very fond of the poor
swallow.</p>

<p>"Tweet, tweet," sang the bird, as he flew out
into the green woods, and Thumbelina felt very
sad. She was not allowed to go out into the
warm sunshine. The corn which had been sowed
in the field over the house of the field mouse had
grown up high into the air and formed a thick
wood to Thumbelina, who was only an inch in
height.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 335px;">
<img src="images/p093i.png" width="335" height="500" alt="Nothing must be wanting when you are the wife of the mole ..." title="" />
</div>

<p>"You are going to be married, little one," said
the field mouse. "My neighbor has asked for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
you. What good fortune for a poor child like
you! Now we will prepare your wedding clothes.
They must be woolen and linen. Nothing must
be wanting when you are the wife of the mole."</p>

<p>Thumbelina had to turn the spindle, and the
field mouse hired four spiders, who were to weave
day and night. Every evening the mole visited
her and was continually speaking of the time
when the summer would be over. Then he
would keep his wedding day with Thumbelina;
but now the heat of the sun was so great that it
burned the earth and made it hard, like stone.
As soon as the summer was over the wedding
should take place. But Thumbelina was not at
all pleased, for she did not like the tiresome mole.</p>

<p>Every morning when the sun rose and every
evening when it went down she would creep out
at the door, and as the wind blew aside the ears
of corn so that she could see the blue sky, she
thought how beautiful and bright it seemed out
there and wished so much to see her dear friend,
the swallow, again. But he never returned, for
by this time he had flown far away into the lovely
green forest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>When autumn arrived Thumbelina had her outfit
quite ready, and the field mouse said to her,
"In four weeks the wedding must take place."</p>

<p>Then she wept and said she would not marry
the disagreeable mole.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," replied the field mouse. "Now
don't be obstinate, or I shall bite you with my
white teeth. He is a very handsome mole; the
queen herself does not wear more beautiful velvets
and furs. His kitchens and cellars are quite
full. You ought to be very thankful for such
good fortune."</p>

<p>So the wedding day was fixed, on which the
mole was to take her away to live with him, deep
under the earth, and never again to see the warm
sun, because <i>he</i> did not like it. The poor child was
very unhappy at the thought of saying farewell
to the beautiful sun, and as the field mouse had
given her permission to stand at the door, she
went to look at it once more.</p>

<p>"Farewell, bright sun," she cried, stretching out
her arm towards it; and then she walked a short
distance from the house, for the corn had been
cut, and only the dry stubble remained in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
fields. "Farewell, farewell," she repeated, twining
her arm around a little red flower that grew just
by her side. "Greet the little swallow from me, if
you should see him again."</p>

<p>"Tweet, tweet," sounded over her head suddenly.
She looked up, and there was the swallow
himself flying close by. As soon as he spied
Thumbelina he was delighted. She told him how
unwilling she was to marry the ugly mole, and to
live always beneath the earth, nevermore to see
the bright sun. And as she told him, she wept.</p>

<p>"Cold winter is coming," said the swallow,
"and I am going to fly away into warmer countries.
Will you go with me? You can sit on my
back and fasten yourself on with your sash. Then
we can fly away from the ugly mole and his gloomy
rooms&mdash;far away, over the mountains, into
warmer countries, where the sun shines more
brightly than here; where it is always summer,
and the flowers bloom in greater beauty. Fly
now with me, dear little one; you saved my life
when I lay frozen in that dark, dreary passage."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will go with you," said Thumbelina;
and she seated herself on the bird's back, with her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
feet on his outstretched wings, and tied her girdle
to one of his strongest feathers.</p>

<p>The swallow rose in the air and flew over forest
and over sea&mdash;high above the highest mountains,
covered with eternal snow. Thumbelina would
have been frozen in the cold air, but she crept
under the bird's warm feathers, keeping her little
head uncovered, so that she might admire the
beautiful lands over which they passed. At
length they reached the warm countries, where
the sun shines brightly and the sky seems so
much higher above the earth. Here on the
hedges and by the wayside grew purple, green,
and white grapes, lemons and oranges hung from
trees in the fields, and the air was fragrant with
myrtles and orange blossoms. Beautiful children
ran along the country lanes, playing with large
gay butterflies; and as the swallow flew farther
and farther, every place appeared still more
lovely.</p>

<p>At last they came to a blue lake, and by the side
of it, shaded by trees of the deepest green, stood a
palace of dazzling white marble, built in the olden
times. Vines clustered round its lofty pillars, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
at the top were many swallows' nests, and one of
these was the home of the swallow who carried
Thumbelina.</p>

<p>"This is my house," said the swallow; "but
it would not do for you to live there&mdash;you would
not be comfortable. You must choose for yourself
one of those lovely flowers, and I will put you
down upon it, and then you shall have everything
that you can wish to make you happy."</p>

<p>"That will be delightful," she said, and clapped
her little hands for joy.</p>

<p>A large marble pillar lay on the ground, which,
in falling, had been broken into three pieces. Between
these pieces grew the most beautiful large
white flowers, so the swallow flew down with
Thumbelina and placed her on one of the broad
leaves. But how surprised she was to see in the
middle of the flower a tiny little man, as white
and transparent as if he had been made of crystal!
He had a gold crown on his head, and delicate
wings at his shoulders, and was not much larger
than was she herself. He was the angel of the
flower, for a tiny man and a tiny woman dwell in
every flower, and this was the king of them all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, how beautiful he is!" whispered Thumbelina
to the swallow.</p>

<p>The little prince was at first quite frightened at
the bird, who was like a giant compared to such a
delicate little creature as himself; but when he
saw Thumbelina he was delighted and thought
her the prettiest little maiden he had ever seen.
He took the gold crown from his head and placed
it on hers, and asked her name and if she would
be his wife and queen over all the flowers.</p>

<p>This certainly was a very different sort of husband
from the son of the toad, or the mole with
his black velvet and fur, so she said Yes to the
handsome prince. Then all the flowers opened,
and out of each came a little lady or a tiny lord,
all so pretty it was quite a pleasure to look at
them. Each of them brought Thumbelina a present;
but the best gift was a pair of beautiful
wings, which had belonged to a large white fly,
and they fastened them to Thumbelina's shoulders,
so that she might fly from flower to flower.</p>

<p>Then there was much rejoicing, and the little
swallow, who sat above them in his nest, was
asked to sing a wedding song, which he did as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
well as he could; but in his heart he felt sad, for
he was very fond of Thumbelina and would have
liked never to part from her again.</p>

<p>"You must not be called Thumbelina any
more," said the spirit of the flowers to her. "It
is an ugly name, and you are so very lovely. We
will call you Maia."</p>

<p>"Farewell, farewell," said the swallow, with a
heavy heart, as he left the warm countries, to fly
back into Denmark. There he had a nest over
the window of a house in which dwelt the writer
of fairy tales. The swallow sang "Tweet, tweet,"
and from his song came the whole story.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said the Rain, "but
now it is my turn. Have you not been
howling round the corner this long time, as hard
as ever you could?"</p>

<p>"Is this the gratitude you owe me?" said the
Wind; "I, who in honor of you turn inside out&mdash;yes,
even break&mdash;all the umbrellas, when the
people won't have anything to do with you."</p>

<p>"I will speak myself," said the Sunshine.
"Silence!" and the Sunshine said it with such
glory and majesty that the weary Wind fell prostrate,
and the Rain, beating against him, shook
him, as she said:</p>

<p>"We won't stand it! She is always breaking
through&mdash;is Madame Sunshine. Let us not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
listen to her; what she has to say is not worth
hearing." And still the Sunshine began to talk,
and this is what she said:</p>

<p>"A beautiful swan flew over the rolling, tossing
waves of the ocean. Every one of its feathers
shone like gold; and one feather drifted down to
the great merchant vessel that, with sails all set,
was sailing away.</p>

<p>"The feather fell upon the light curly hair of
a young man, whose business it was to care for
the goods in the ship&mdash;the supercargo he was
called. The feather of the bird of fortune touched
his forehead, became a pen in his hand, and
brought him such luck that he soon became a
wealthy merchant, rich enough to have bought
for himself spurs of gold&mdash;rich enough to change
a golden plate into a nobleman's shield, on which,"
said the Sunshine, "I shone."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"The swan flew farther, away and away, over
the sunny green meadow, where the little shepherd
boy, only seven years old, had lain down
in the shade of the old tree, the only one there
was in sight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"In its flight the swan kissed one of the leaves
of the tree, and falling into the boy's hand, it was
changed to three leaves&mdash;to ten&mdash;to a whole
book; yes, and in the book he read about all
the wonders of nature, about his native language,
about faith and knowledge. At night he laid the
book under his pillow, that he might not forget
what he had been reading.</p>

<p>"The wonderful book led him also to the
schoolroom, and thence everywhere, in search of
knowledge. I have read his name among the
names of learned men," said the Sunshine.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"The swan flew into the quiet, lonely forest,
and rested awhile on the deep, dark lake where
the lilies grow, where the wild apples are to be
found on the shore, where the cuckoo and the
wild pigeon have their homes.</p>

<p>"In the wood was a poor woman gathering
firewood&mdash;branches and dry sticks that had
fallen. She bore them on her back in a bundle,
and in her arms she held her little child. She
too saw the golden swan, the bird of fortune, as
it rose from among the reeds on the shore. What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
was it that glittered so? A golden egg that was
still quite warm. She laid it in her bosom, and the
warmth remained. Surely there was life in the egg!
She heard the gentle pecking inside the shell, but
she thought it was her own heart that was beating.</p>

<p>"At home in her poor cottage she took out
the egg. 'Tick! tick!' it said, as if it had been
a gold watch, but it was not; it was an egg&mdash;a
real, living egg.</p>

<p>"The egg cracked and opened, and a dear little
baby swan, all feathered as with the purest
gold, pushed out its tiny head. Around its neck
were four rings, and as this woman had four
boys&mdash;three at home, and this little one that was
with her in the lonely wood&mdash;she understood at
once that there was one for each boy. Just as she
had taken them the little gold bird took flight.</p>

<p>"She kissed each ring, then made each of the
children kiss one of the rings, laid it next the
child's heart awhile, then put it on his finger. I
saw it all," said the Sunshine, "and I saw what
happened afterward.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/p105i.png" width="339" height="500" alt="The egg cracked and opened...." title="" />
</div>

<p>"One of the boys, while playing by a ditch,
took a lump of clay in his hand, then turned and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
twisted it till it took shape and was like Jason,
who went in search of the Golden Fleece and
found it.</p>

<p>"The second boy ran out upon the meadow,
where stood the flowers&mdash;flowers of all imaginable
colors. He gathered a handful and squeezed
them so tightly that the juice flew into his eyes,
and some of it wet the ring upon his hand. It
cribbled and crawled in his brain and in his
hands, and after many a day and many a year,
people in the great city talked of the famous
painter that he was.</p>

<p>"The third child held the ring in his teeth,
and so tightly that it gave forth sound&mdash;the echo
of a song in the depth of his heart. Then
thoughts and feelings rose in beautiful sounds,&mdash;rose
like singing swans,&mdash;plunged, too, like swans,
into the deep, deep sea. He became a great
musical composer, a master, of whom every country
has the right to say, 'He was mine, for he
was the world's.'</p>

<p>"And the fourth little one&mdash;yes, he was the
'ugly duck' of the family. They said he had the
pip and must eat pepper and butter like a sick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
chicken, and that was what was given him; but
of me he got a warm, sunny kiss," said the Sunshine.
"He had ten kisses for one. He was a
poet and was first kissed, then buffeted all his
life through.</p>

<p>"But he held what no one could take from
him&mdash;the ring of fortune from Dame Fortune's
golden swan. His thoughts took wing and flew
up and away like singing butterflies&mdash;emblems
of an immortal life."</p>

<p>"That was a dreadfully long story," said the
Wind.</p>

<p>"And so stupid and tiresome," said the Rain.
"Blow upon me, please, that I may revive a little."</p>

<p>And while the Wind blew, the Sunshine said:
"The swan of fortune flew over the lovely bay
where the fishermen had set their nets. The
very poorest one among them was wishing to
marry&mdash;and marry he did.</p>

<p>"To him the swan brought a piece of amber.
Amber draws things toward itself, and this piece
drew hearts to the house where the fisherman
lived with his bride. Amber is the most wonderful
of incense, and there came a soft perfume, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
from a holy place, a sweet breath from beautiful
nature, that God has made. And the fisherman
and his wife were happy and grateful in their
peaceful home, content even in their poverty.
And so their life became a real Sunshine Story."</p>

<p>"I think we had better stop now," said the
Wind. "I am dreadfully bored. The Sunshine
has talked long enough."</p>

<p>"I think so, too," said the Rain.</p>

<p>And what do we others who have heard the
story say?</p>

<p>We say, "Now the story's done."</p>

<h2>THE DARNING-NEEDLE</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;"><img src="images/drop-t.png" width="83" height="100" alt="T" title="" /></div><div class='unindent'>HERE was once a Darning-needle who
thought herself so fine that she came at last
to believe that she was fit for embroidery.</div>

<p>"Mind now that you hold me fast," she said to
the Fingers that took her up. "Pray don't lose
me. If I should fall on the ground I should certainly
be lost, I am so fine."</p>

<p>"That's more than you can tell," said the Fingers,
as they grasped her tightly by the waist.</p>

<p>"I come with a train, you see," said the Darning-needle,
as she drew her long thread after her; but
there was no knot in the thread.</p>

<p>The Fingers pressed the point of the Needle
upon an old pair of slippers, in which the upper
leather had burst and must be sewed together.
The slippers belonged to the cook.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is very coarse work!" said the Darning-needle.
"I shall never get through alive. There,
I'm breaking! I'm breaking!" and break she did.
"Did I not say so?" said the Darning-needle.
"I'm too delicate for such work as that."</p>

<p>"Now it's quite useless for sewing," said the
Fingers; but they still held her all the same, for
the cook presently dropped some melted sealing
wax upon the needle and then pinned her neckerchief
in front with it.</p>

<p>"See, now I'm a breastpin," said the Darning-needle.
"I well knew that I should come to
honor; when one is something, one always comes
to something. Merit is sure to rise." And at
this she laughed, only inwardly, of course, for
one can never see when a Darning-needle laughs.
There she sat now, quite at her ease, and as
proud as if she sat in a state carriage and gazed
upon all about her.</p>

<p>"May I take the liberty to ask if you are made
of gold?" she asked of the pin, her neighbor.
"You have a splendid appearance and quite a
remarkable head, though it is so little. You
should do what you can to grow&mdash;of course it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
not every one that can have sealing wax dropped
upon her."</p>

<p>And the Darning-needle drew herself up so
proudly that she fell out of the neckerchief into the
sink, which the cook was at that moment rinsing.</p>

<p>"Now I'm going to travel," said the Darning-needle,
"if only I don't get lost."</p>

<p>But that was just what happened to her.</p>

<p>"I'm too delicate for this world," she said, as
she found herself in the gutter. "But I know
who I am, and there is always some little pleasure
in that!" It was thus that the Darning-needle
kept up her proud bearing and lost none of her
good humor. And now all sorts of things swam
over her&mdash;chips and straws and scraps of old
newspapers.</p>

<p>"Only see how they sail along," said the Darning-needle
to herself. "They little know what is
under them, though it is I, and I sit firmly here.
See! there goes a chip! It thinks of nothing in
the world but itself&mdash;of nothing in the world but
a chip! There floats a straw; see how it turns
and twirls about. Do think of something besides
yourself or you may easily run against a stone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
There swims a bit of a newspaper. What's written
upon it is forgotten long ago, yet how it
spreads itself out and gives itself airs! I sit
patiently and quietly here! I know what I am,
and I shall remain the same&mdash;always."</p>

<p>One day there lay something beside her that
glittered splendidly. She thought it must be a
diamond, but it was really only a bit of broken
glass from a bottle. As it shone so brightly the
Darning-needle spoke to it, introducing herself
as a breastpin.</p>

<p>"You are a diamond, I suppose," she said.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, something of the sort."</p>

<p>So each believed the other to be some rare and
costly trinket; and they began to converse together
upon the world, saying how very conceited
it was.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Darning-needle, "I have lived
in a young lady's box; and the young lady happened
to be a cook. She had five fingers upon
each of her hands, and anything more conceited
and arrogant than those five fingers, I never saw.
And yet they were only there that they might
take me out of the box or put me back again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Were they of high descent?" asked the Bit of
Bottle. "Did they shine?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," replied the Darning-needle; "but
they were none the less haughty. There were five
brothers of them&mdash;all of the Finger family. And
they held themselves so proudly side by side,
though they were of quite different heights. The
outermost, Thumbling he was called, was short
and thick set; he generally stood out of the rank,
a little in front of the others; he had only one
joint in his back, and could only bow once; but
he used to say that if he were cut off from a man,
that man would be cut off from military service.
Foreman, the second, put himself forward on all
occasions, meddled with sweet and sour, pointed
to sun and moon, and when the fingers wrote,
it was he who pressed the pen. Middleman, the
third of the brothers, could look over the others'
heads, and gave himself airs for that. Ringman,
the fourth, went about with a gold belt about his
waist; and little Playman, whom they called Peter
Spielman, did nothing at all and was proud of
that, I suppose. There was nothing to be heard
but boasting, and that is why I took myself away."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"And now we sit here together and shine,"
said the Bit of Bottle.</p>

<p>At that very moment some water came rushing
along the gutter, so that it overflowed and
carried the glass diamond along with it.</p>

<p>"So he is off," said the Darning-needle, "and
I still remain. I am left here because I am too
slender and genteel. But that's my pride, and
pride is honorable." And proudly she sat, thinking
many thoughts.</p>

<p>"I could almost believe I had been born of
a sunbeam, I'm so fine. It seems as if the sunbeams
were always trying to seek me under the
water. Alas, I'm so delicate that even my own
mother cannot find me. If I had my old eye still,
which broke off, I think I should cry&mdash;but no,
I would not; it's not genteel to weep."</p>

<p>One day a couple of street boys were paddling
about in the gutter, hunting for old nails, pennies,
and such like. It was dirty work, but they seemed
to find great pleasure in it.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" cried one of them, as he pricked
himself with the Darning-needle; "here's a fellow
for you!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not a fellow! I'm a young lady!" said
the Darning-needle, but no one heard it.</p>

<p>The sealing wax had worn off, and she had
become quite black; "but black makes one look
slender, and is always becoming." She thought
herself finer even than before.</p>

<p>"There goes an eggshell sailing along," said
the boys; and they stuck the Darning-needle
into the shell.</p>

<p>"A lady in black, and within white walls!"
said the Darning-needle; "that is very striking.
Now every one can see me. I hope I shall not
be seasick, for then I shall break."</p>

<p>But the fear was needless; she was not seasick,
neither did she break.</p>

<p>"Nothing is so good to prevent seasickness as
to have a steel stomach and to bear in mind that
one is something a little more than an ordinary
person. My seasickness is all over now. The
more genteel and honorable one is, the more
one can endure."</p>

<p>Crash went the eggshell, as a wagon rolled
over both of them. It was a wonder that she
did not break.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mercy, what a crushing weight!" said the
Darning-needle. "I'm growing seasick, after all.
I'm going to break!"</p>

<p>But she was not sick, and she did not break,
though the wagon wheels rolled over her. She lay
at full length in the road, and there let her lie.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 38px;"><img src="images/drop-i.png" width="38" height="100" alt="I" title="" /></div><div class='unindent'>T was dreadfully cold; it was snowing fast,
and was almost dark, as evening came on&mdash;the
last evening of the year. In the cold and
the darkness, there went along the street a poor
little girl, bareheaded and with naked feet. When
she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but
they were much too large for her feet&mdash;slippers
that her mother had used till then, and the poor
little girl lost them in running across the street
when two carriages were passing terribly fast.
When she looked for them, one was not to be
found, and a boy seized the other and ran away
with it, saying he would use it for a cradle some
day, when he had children of his own.</div>

<p>So on the little girl went with her bare feet,
that were red and blue with cold. In an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
apron that she wore were bundles of matches, and
she carried a bundle also in her hand. No one
had bought so much as a bunch all the long day,
and no one had given her even a penny.</p>

<p>Poor little girl! Shivering with cold and hunger
she crept along, a perfect picture of misery.</p>

<p>The snowflakes fell on her long flaxen hair,
which hung in pretty curls about her throat; but
she thought not of her beauty nor of the cold.
Lights gleamed in every window, and there came
to her the savory smell of roast goose, for it was
New Year's Eve. And it was this of which she
thought.</p>

<p>In a corner formed by two houses, one of which
projected beyond the other, she sat cowering
down. She had drawn under her her little feet, but
still she grew colder and colder; yet she dared
not go home, for she had sold no matches and
could not bring a penny of money. Her father
would certainly beat her; and, besides, it was cold
enough at home, for they had only the house-roof
above them, and though the largest holes had
been stopped with straw and rags, there were left
many through which the cold wind could whistle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/p119i.png" width="339" height="500" alt="Where the light fell upon the wall it became transparent." title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>And now her little hands were nearly frozen
with cold. Alas! a single match might do her
good if she might only draw it from the bundle,
rub it against the wall, and warm her fingers by
it. So at last she drew one out. Whisht! How
it blazed and burned! It gave out a warm, bright
flame like a little candle, as she held her hands
over it. A wonderful little light it was. It really
seemed to the little girl as if she sat before a
great iron stove with polished brass feet and
brass shovel and tongs. So blessedly it burned
that the little maiden stretched out her feet to
warm them also. How comfortable she was! But
lo! the flame went out, the stove vanished, and
nothing remained but the little burned match in
her hand.</p>

<p>She rubbed another match against the wall. It
burned brightly, and where the light fell upon the
wall it became transparent like a veil, so that she
could see through it into the room. A snow-white
cloth was spread upon the table, on which
was a beautiful china dinner-service, while a roast
goose, stuffed with apples and prunes, steamed
famously and sent forth a most savory smell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
And what was more delightful still, and wonderful,
the goose jumped from the dish, with knife
and fork still in its breast, and waddled along the
floor straight to the little girl.</p>

<p>But the match went out then, and nothing was
left to her but the thick, damp wall.</p>

<p>She lighted another match. And now she was
under a most beautiful Christmas tree, larger and
far more prettily trimmed than the one she had
seen through the glass doors at the rich merchant's.
Hundreds of wax tapers were burning
on the green branches, and gay figures, such as
she had seen in shop windows, looked down upon
her. The child stretched out her hands to them;
then the match went out.</p>

<p>Still the lights of the Christmas tree rose
higher and higher. She saw them now as stars
in heaven, and one of them fell, forming a long
trail of fire.</p>

<p>"Now some one is dying," murmured the child
softly; for her grandmother, the only person who
had loved her, and who was now dead, had told
her that whenever a star falls a soul mounts up
to God.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>She struck yet another match against the wall,
and again it was light; and in the brightness
there appeared before her the dear old grandmother,
bright and radiant, yet sweet and mild,
and happy as she had never looked on earth.</p>

<p>"Oh, grandmother," cried the child, "take me
with you. I know you will go away when the
match burns out. You, too, will vanish, like the
warm stove, the splendid New Year's feast,
the beautiful Christmas tree." And lest her
grandmother should disappear, she rubbed the
whole bundle of matches against the wall.</p>

<p>And the matches burned with such a brilliant
light that it became brighter than noonday. Her
grandmother had never looked so grand and beautiful.
She took the little girl in her arms, and
both flew together, joyously and gloriously, mounting
higher and higher, far above the earth; and
for them there was neither hunger, nor cold, nor
care&mdash;they were with God.</p>

<p>But in the corner, at the dawn of day, sat
the poor girl, leaning against the wall, with red
cheeks and smiling mouth&mdash;frozen to death on
the last evening of the old year. Stiff and cold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
she sat, with the matches, one bundle of which
was burned.</p>

<p>"She wanted to warm herself, poor little thing,"
people said. No one imagined what sweet visions
she had had, or how gloriously she had gone
with her grandmother to enter upon the joys of
a new year.</p>

<h2>THE LOVING PAIR</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 101px;"><img src="images/drop-a.png" width="101" height="100" alt="A" title="" /></div><div class='unindent'> &nbsp; WHIPPING Top and a Ball lay close
together in a drawer among other playthings.
One day the Top said to the
Ball, "Since we are living so much together, why
should we not be lovers?"</div>

<p>But the Ball, being made of morocco leather,
thought herself a very high-bred lady, and would
hear nothing of such a proposal. On the next
day the little boy to whom the playthings belonged
came to the drawer; he painted the Top
red and yellow, and drove a bright brass nail right
through the head of it; it looked very smart indeed
as it spun around after that.</p>

<p>"Look at me," said he to the Ball. "What do
you say to me now; why should we not make a
match of it, and become man and wife? We suit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
each other so well!&mdash;you can jump and I can
dance. There would not be a happier pair in the
whole world!"</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" said the Ball. "Perhaps
you do not know that my father and mother were
morocco slippers, and that I have a Spanish cork
in my body!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but then I am made of mahogany," said
the Top; "the Mayor himself turned me. He
has a turning lathe of his own, and he took great
pleasure in making me."</p>

<p>"Can I trust you in this?" asked the Ball.</p>

<p>"May I never be whipped again, if what I tell
you is not true," returned the Top.</p>

<p>"You plead your cause well," said the Ball;
"but I am not free to listen to your proposal. I
am as good as engaged to a swallow. As often as
I fly up into the air, he puts his head out of his
nest, and says, 'Will you?' In my heart I have
said Yes to him, and that is almost the same as
an engagement; but I'll promise never to forget
you."</p>

<p>"A deal of good that will do me," said the Top,
and they left off speaking to each other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day the Ball was taken out. The Top
saw it fly like a bird into the air&mdash;so high that it
passed quite out of sight. It came back again; but
each time that it touched the earth, it sprang higher
than before. This must have been either from its
longing to mount higher, like the swallow, or because
it had the Spanish cork in its body. On the
ninth time the little Ball did not return. The boy
sought and sought, but all in vain, for it was gone.</p>

<p>"I know very well where she is," sighed the
Top. "She is in the swallow's nest, celebrating
her wedding."</p>

<p>The more the Top thought of this the more
lovely the Ball became to him; that she could not
be his bride seemed to make his love for her the
greater. She had preferred another rather than
himself, but he could not forget her. He twirled
round and round, spinning and humming, but
always thinking of the Ball, who grew more and
more beautiful the more he thought of her. And
thus several years passed,&mdash;it came to be an old
love,&mdash;and now the Top was no longer young!</p>

<p>One day he was gilded all over; never in his
life had he been half so handsome. He was now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
a golden top, and bravely he spun, humming all
the time. But once he sprang too high&mdash;and
was gone!</p>

<p>They looked everywhere for him,&mdash;even in the
cellar,&mdash;but he was nowhere to be found. Where
was he?</p>

<p>He had jumped into the dustbin, and lay among
cabbage stalks, sweepings, dust, and all sorts of
rubbish that had fallen from the gutter in the
roof.</p>

<p>"Alas! my gay gilding will soon be spoiled
here. What sort of trumpery can I have got
among?" And then he peeped at a long cabbage
stalk which lay much too near him, and at something
strange and round, which appeared like an
apple, but was not. It was an old Ball that must
have lain for years in the gutter, and been soaked
through and through with water.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness! at last I see an equal; one
of my own sort, with whom I can talk," said the
Ball, looking earnestly at the gilded Top. "I am
myself made of real morocco, sewed together by
a young lady's hands, and within my body is a
Spanish cork; though no one would think it now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
I was very near marrying the swallow, when by
a sad chance I fell into the gutter on the roof. I
have lain there five years, and I am now wet
through and through. You may think what a
wearisome situation it has been for a young lady
like me."</p>

<p>The Top made no reply. The more he thought
of his old love, and the more he heard, the more
sure he became that this was indeed she.</p>

<p>Then came the housemaid to empty the dustbin.
"Hullo!" she cried; "why, here's the gilt
Top." And so the Top was brought again to the
playroom, to be used and honored as before, while
nothing was again heard of the Ball.</p>

<p>And the Top never spoke again of his old love&mdash;the
feeling must have passed away. And it is
not strange, when the object of it has lain five
years in a gutter, and been drenched through
and through, and when one meets her again in
a dustbin.</p>

<h2>THE LEAPING MATCH</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;"><img src="images/drop-t.png" width="83" height="100" alt="T" title="" /></div><div class='unindent'>HE Flea, the Grasshopper, and the Frog
once wanted to see which of them could
jump the highest. They made a festival,
and invited the whole world and every one else
besides who liked to come and see the grand sight.
Three famous jumpers they were, as all should
say, when they met together in the room.</div>

<p>"I will give my daughter to him who shall
jump highest," said the King; "it would be
too bad for you to have the jumping, and for us
to offer no prize."</p>

<p>The Flea was the first to come forward. He had
most exquisite manners, and bowed to the company
on every side; for he was of noble blood, and,
besides, was accustomed to the society of man,
and that, of course, had been an advantage to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Next came the Grasshopper. He was not quite
so elegantly formed as the Flea, but he knew
perfectly well how to conduct himself, and he
wore the green uniform which belonged to him by
right of birth. He said, moreover, that he came
of a very ancient Egyptian family, and that in the
house where he then lived he was much thought of.</p>

<p>The fact was that he had been just brought
out of the fields and put in a card-house three
stories high, and built on purpose for him, with
the colored sides inwards, and doors and windows
cut out of the Queen of Hearts. "And I sing so
well," said he, "that sixteen parlor-bred crickets,
who have chirped from infancy and yet got no
one to build them card-houses to live in, have
fretted themselves thinner even than before, from
sheer vexation on hearing me."</p>

<p>It was thus that the Flea and the Grasshopper
made the most of themselves, each thinking himself
quite an equal match for the princess.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/p131i.png" width="339" height="500" alt="He made a sideways jump into the lap of the princess." title="" />
</div>

<p>The Leapfrog said not a word; but people
said that perhaps he thought the more; and the
housedog who snuffed at him with his nose
allowed that he was of good family. The old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
councilor, who had had three orders given him in
vain for keeping quiet, asserted that the Leapfrog
was a prophet, for that one could see on his
back whether the coming winter was to be severe
or mild, which is more than one can see on the
back of the man who writes the almanac.</p>

<p>"I say nothing for the present," exclaimed the
King; "yet I have my own opinion, for I observe
everything."</p>

<p>And now the match began. The Flea jumped
so high that no one could see what had become
of him; and so they insisted that he had not
jumped at all&mdash;which was disgraceful after all
the fuss he had made.</p>

<p>The Grasshopper jumped only half as high;
but he leaped into the King's face, who was disgusted
by his rudeness.</p>

<p>The Leapfrog stood for a long time, as if lost
in thought; people began to think he would not
jump at all.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he is ill!" said the dog and he
went to snuff at him again; when lo! he suddenly
made a sideways jump into the lap of the princess,
who sat close by on a little golden stool.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is nothing higher than my daughter,"
said the King; "therefore to bound into her lap
is the highest jump that can be made. Only one
of good understanding would ever have thought
of that. Thus the Frog has shown that he has
sense. He has brains in his head, that he has."</p>

<p>And so he won the princess.</p>

<p>"I jumped the highest, for all that," said the
Flea; "but it's all the same to me. The princess
may have the stiff-legged, slimy creature, if she
likes. In this world merit seldom meets its reward.
Dullness and heaviness win the day. I am
too light and airy for a stupid world."</p>

<p>And so the Flea went into foreign service.</p>

<p>The Grasshopper sat without on a green bank
and reflected on the world and its ways; and he
too said, "Yes, dullness and heaviness win the
day; a fine exterior is what people care for nowadays."
And then he began to sing in his own
peculiar way&mdash;and it is from his song that we
have taken this little piece of history, which may
very possibly be all untrue, although it does stand
printed here in black and white.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;"><img src="images/drop-t.png" width="83" height="100" alt="T" title="" /></div><div class='unindent'>HE largest green leaf in this country is
certainly the burdock. Put one in front of
your waist, and it is just like an apron; or
lay it upon your head, and it is almost as good
as an umbrella, it is so broad.</div>

<p>Burdock never grows singly; where you find
one plant of the kind you may be sure that others
grow in its immediate neighborhood. How magnificent
they look!</p>

<p>And all this magnificence is food for snails&mdash;the
great white snails, which grand people in olden
times used to have dished up as fricassees, and
of which, when they had eaten, they would say,
"H'm, how nice!" for they really fancied them
delicious. These snails lived on burdock leaves,
and that was why burdock was planted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Now there was an old estate where snails were
no longer considered a delicacy. The snails had
therefore died out, but the burdock still flourished.
In all the alleys and in all the beds it had grown
and grown, so that it could no longer be checked;
the place had become a perfect forest of burdock.</p>

<p>Here and there stood an apple or plum tree to
serve as a kind of token that there had been once
a garden, but everything, from one end of the garden
to the other, was burdock, and beneath the
shade of the burdock lived the last two of the
ancient snails.</p>

<p>They did not know themselves how old they
were, but they well remembered the time when
there were a great many of them, that they had
descended from a family that came from foreign
lands, and that this forest in which they lived had
been planted for them and theirs. They had never
been beyond the limits of the garden, but they
knew that there was something outside their forest,
called the castle, and that there one was
boiled, and became black, and was then laid upon
a silver dish&mdash;though what happened afterward
they had never heard, nor could they exactly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
fancy how it felt to be cooked and laid on a silver
dish. It was, no doubt, a fine thing, and exceedingly
genteel.</p>

<p>Neither the cockchafer, nor the toad, nor the
earthworm, all of whom they questioned on the
matter, could give them the least information, for
none of them had ever been cooked and served
upon silver dishes.</p>

<p>The old white snails were the grandest race in
the world; of this they were well aware. The
forest had grown for their sake, and the castle or
manor house too had been built expressly that
in it they might be cooked and served.</p>

<p>Leading now a very quiet and happy life and
having no children, they had adopted a little common
snail, and had brought it up as their own
child. But the little thing would not grow, for he
was only a common snail, though his foster mother
pretended to see a great improvement in him.
She begged the father, since he could not perceive
it, to feel the little snail's shell, and to her great
joy and his own, he found that his wife was right.</p>

<p>One day it rained very hard. "Listen!" said
the Father Snail; "hear what a drumming there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
is on the burdock leaves&mdash;rum-dum-dum, rum-dum-dum!"</p>

<p>"There are drops, too," said the Mother Snail;
"they come trickling down the stalks. We shall
presently find it very wet here. I'm glad we have
such good houses, and that the youngster has his
also. There has really been more done for us than
for any other creatures. Every one must see that
we are superior beings. We have houses from our
very birth, and the burdock forest is planted on
our account. I should like to know just how far
it reaches, and what there is beyond."</p>

<p>"There is nothing better than what we have here,"
said the Father Snail. "I wish for nothing beyond."</p>

<p>"And yet," said the mother, "I should like to
be taken to the castle, and boiled, and laid on a
silver dish; that has been the destiny of all our
ancestors, and we may be sure it is something
quite out of the common way."</p>

<p>"The castle has perhaps fallen to ruin," said
the Father Snail, "or it may be overgrown with
burdock, so that its inmates are unable to come
out. There is no hurry about the matter. You
are always in such a desperate hurry, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
youngster there begins to take after you. He's
been creeping up that stem yonder these three
days. It makes me quite dizzy to look at him."</p>

<p>"But don't scold him," said the mother. "He
creeps carefully. We old people have nothing else
to live for, and he will be the joy of our old age.
Have you thought how we can manage to find a
wife for him? Do you not think that farther into
the forest there may be others of our own species?"</p>

<p>"I dare say there may be black snails," said the
old father, "black snails, without a house at all;
and they are vulgar, though they think so much
of themselves. But we can employ the black ants,
who run about so much&mdash;hurrying to and fro as
if they had all the business of the world on their
hands. They will certainly be able to find a wife
for our young gentleman."</p>

<p>"I know the fairest of the fair," said one of the
ants; "but I'm afraid it would not do, for she's
a queen."</p>

<p>"She's none the worse for that," said both the
old snails. "Has she a house?"</p>

<p>"She has a palace," answered the ants; "the most
splendid ant castle, with seven hundred galleries."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you!" said the Mother Snail. "Our
boy shall not go to live in an ant hill. If you
know of nothing better, we will employ the white
gnats, who fly both in rain and sunshine and know
all the ins and outs of the whole burdock forest."</p>

<p>"We have found a wife for him," said the
gnats. "A hundred paces from here there sits,
on a gooseberry bush, a little snail with a house.
She is all alone and is old enough to marry. It
is only a hundred human steps from here."</p>

<p>"Then let her come to him," said the old couple.
"He has a whole forest of burdock, while she
has only a bush."</p>

<p>So they went and brought the little maiden
snail. It took eight days to perform the journey,
but that only showed her high breeding, and that
she was of good family.</p>

<p>And then the wedding took place. Six glow-worms
gave all the light they could, but in all
other respects it was a very quiet affair. The old
people could not bear the fatigue of frolic or festivity.
The Mother Snail made a very touching
little speech. The father was too much overcome
to trust himself to say anything.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>They gave the young couple the entire burdock
forest, saying what they had always said, namely,
that it was the finest inheritance in the world,
and that if they led an upright and honorable life,
and if their family should increase, without doubt
both themselves and their children would one day
be taken to the manor castle and be boiled black
and served as a fricassee in a silver dish.</p>

<p>And after this the old couple crept into their
houses and never came out again, but fell asleep.
The young pair now ruled in the forest and had
a numerous family. But when, as time went on,
none of them were ever cooked or served on a
silver dish, they concluded that the castle had
fallen to ruin and that the world of human beings
had died out; and as no one contradicted them,
they must have been right.</p>

<p>And the rain continued to fall upon the burdock
leaves solely to entertain them with its
drumming, and the sun shone to light the forest
for their especial benefit, and very happy they
were&mdash;they and the whole snail family&mdash;inexpressibly
happy!</p>

<h2>THE GREENIES</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 101px;"><img src="images/drop-a.png" width="101" height="100" alt="A" title="" /></div><div class='unindent'> ROSE TREE stood in the window. But
a little while ago it had been green and
fresh, and now it looked sickly&mdash;it was
in poor health, no doubt. A whole regiment was
quartered on it and was eating it up; yet, notwithstanding
this seeming greediness, the regiment
was a very decent and respectable one. It
wore bright-green uniforms. I spoke to one of
the "Greenies." He was but three days old, and
yet he was already a grandfather. What do you
think he said? It is all true&mdash;he spoke of himself
and of the rest of the regiment. Listen!</div>

<p>"We are the most wonderful creatures in the
world. At a very early age we are engaged, and
immediately we have the wedding. When the
cold weather comes we lay our eggs, but the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
ones lie sunny and warm. The wisest of the
creatures, the ant,&mdash;we have the greatest respect
for him!&mdash;understands us well. He appreciates us,
you may be sure. He does not eat us up at once;
he takes our eggs, lays them in the family ant hill
on the ground floor&mdash;lays them, labeled and
numbered, side by side, layer on layer, so that
each day a new one may creep out of the egg.
Then he puts us in a stable, pinches our hind
legs, and milks us till we die. He has given us
the prettiest of names&mdash;'little milch cow.'</p>

<p>"All creatures who, like the ant, are gifted with
common sense call us by this pretty name. It is
only human beings who do not. They give us
another name, one that we feel to be a great
affront&mdash;great enough to embitter our whole life.
Could you not write a protest against it for us?
Could you not rouse these human beings to a
sense of the wrong they do us? They look at us
so stupidly or, at times, with such envious eyes,
just because we eat a rose leaf, while they themselves
eat every created thing&mdash;whatever grows
and is green. And oh, they give us the most
humiliating of names! I will not even mention it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Ugh! I feel it to my very stomach. I cannot
even pronounce it&mdash;at least not when I have my
uniform on, and that I always wear.</p>

<p>"I was born on a rose leaf. I and all the regiment
live on the rose tree. We live off it, in fact.
But then it lives again in us, who belong to the
higher order of created beings.</p>

<p>"The human beings do not like us. They pursue
and murder us with soapsuds. Oh, it is a
horrid drink! I seem to smell it even now. You
cannot think how dreadful it is to be washed
when one was not made to be washed. Men! you
who look at us with your severe, soapsud eyes,
think a moment what our place in nature is: we
are born upon the roses, we die in roses&mdash;our
whole life is a rose poem. Do not, I beg you, give
us a name which you yourselves think so despicable&mdash;the
name I cannot bear to pronounce.
If you wish to speak of us, call us 'the ants'
milch cows&mdash;the rose-tree regiment&mdash;the little
green things.'"</p>

<p>"And I, the man, stood looking at the tree
and at the little Greenies (whose name I shall
not mention, for I should not like to wound the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
feelings of the citizens of the rose tree), a large
family with eggs and young ones; and I looked
at the soapsuds I was going to wash them in,
for I too had come with soap and water and
murderous intentions. But now I will use it for
soap bubbles. Look, how beautiful! Perhaps there
lies in each a fairy tale, and the bubble grows
large and radiant and looks as if there were a
pearl lying inside it.</p>

<p>The bubble swayed and swung. It flew to the
door and then burst, but the door opened wide,
and there stood Dame Fairytale herself! And
now she will tell you better than I can about
(I will not say the name) the little green things
of the rosebush.</p>

<p>"Plant lice!" said Dame Fairytale. One must
call things by their right names. And if one may
not do so always, one must at least have the
privilege of doing so in a fairy tale.</p>

<h2>OLE-LUK-OIE THE DREAM GOD</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;"><img src="images/drop-t.png" width="83" height="100" alt="T" title="" /></div><div class='unindent'>HERE is nobody in the whole world who
knows so many stories as Ole-Luk-Oie, or
who can relate them so nicely.</div>

<p>In the evening while the children are seated at
the tea table or in their little chairs, very softly he
comes up the stairs, for he walks in his socks.
He opens the doors without the slightest noise
and throws a small quantity of very fine dust in
the little ones' eyes (just enough to prevent them
from keeping them open), and so they do not see
him. Then he creeps behind them and blows
softly upon their necks till their heads begin to
droop.</p>

<p>But Ole-Luk-Oie does not wish to hurt them.
He is very fond of children and only wants them
to be quiet that he may tell them pretty stories,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and he knows they never are quiet until they are
in bed and asleep. Ole-Luk-Oie seats himself
upon the bed as soon as they are asleep. He is
nicely dressed; his coat is made of silken stuff, it
is impossible to say of what color, for it changes
from green to red and from red to blue as he
turns from side to side. Under each arm he carries
an umbrella. One of them, with pictures on
the inside, he spreads over good children, and then
they dream the most charming stories. But the
other umbrella has no pictures, and this he holds
over the naughty children, so that they sleep
heavily and wake in the morning without having
dreamed at all.</p>

<p>Now we shall hear how Ole-Luk-Oie came
every night during a whole week to a little boy
named Hjalmar, and what it was that he told him.
There were seven stories, as there are seven days
in the week.</p>


<div class='center'><br />MONDAY</div>

<p>"Now pay attention," said Ole-Luk-Oie in the
evening, when Hjalmar was in bed, "and I will
decorate the room."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Immediately all the flowers in the flowerpots
became large trees with long branches reaching
to the ceiling and stretching along the walls,
so that the whole room was like a greenhouse.
All the branches were loaded with flowers, each
flower as beautiful and as fragrant as a rose, and
had any one tasted them he would have found
them sweeter even than jam. The fruit glittered
like gold, and there were cakes so full of plums
that they were nearly bursting. It was incomparably
beautiful.</p>

<p>At the same time sounded dismal moans from
the table drawer in which lay Hjalmar's schoolbooks.</p>

<p>"What can that be now?" said Ole-Luk-Oie,
going to the table and pulling out the drawer.</p>

<p>It was a slate, in such distress because of a
wrong figure in a sum that it had almost broken
itself to pieces. The pencil pulled and tugged at
its string as if it were a little dog that wanted
to help but could not.</p>

<p>And then came a moan from Hjalmar's copy
book. Oh, it was quite terrible to hear! On
each leaf stood a row of capital letters, every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
one having a small letter by its side. This
formed a copy. Under these were other letters,
which Hjalmar had written; they fancied they
looked like the copy, but they were mistaken,
for they were leaning on one side as if they
intended to fall over the pencil lines.</p>

<p>"See, this is the way you should hold yourselves,"
said the copy. "Look here, you should
slope thus, with a graceful curve."</p>

<p>"Oh, we are very willing to do so," said
Hjalmar's letters, "but we cannot, we are so
wretchedly made."</p>

<p>"You must be scratched out, then," said
Ole-Luk-Oie.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" they cried, and then they stood up
so gracefully that it was quite a pleasure to look
at them.</p>

<p>"Now we must give up our stories, and exercise
these letters," said Ole-Luk-Oie. "One, two&mdash;one,
two&mdash;" So he drilled them till they stood
up gracefully and looked as beautiful as a copy
could look. But after Ole-Luk-Oie was gone, and
Hjalmar looked at them in the morning, they
were as wretched and awkward as ever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />TUESDAY</div>

<p>As soon as Hjalmar was in bed Ole-Luk-Oie
touched with his little magic wand all the furniture
in the room, which immediately began to
chatter. And each article talked only of itself.</p>

<p>Over the chest of drawers hung a large picture
in a gilt frame, representing a landscape,
with fine old trees, flowers in the grass, and
a broad stream which flowed through the
wood past several castles far out into the wild
ocean.</p>

<p>Ole-Luk-Oie touched the picture with his magic
wand, and immediately the birds began to sing,
the branches of the trees rustled, and the clouds
moved across the sky, casting their shadows on
the landscape beneath them.</p>

<p>Then Ole-Luk-Oie lifted little Hjalmar up to
the frame and placed his feet in the picture, on
the high grass, and there he stood with the sun
shining down upon him through the branches of
the trees. He ran to the water and seated himself
in a little boat which lay there, and which
was painted red and white.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The sails glittered like silver, and six swans,
each with a golden circlet round its neck and a
bright, blue star on its forehead, drew the boat
past the green wood, where the trees talked of
robbers and witches, and the flowers of beautiful
little elves and fairies whose histories the butterflies
had related to them.</p>

<p>Brilliant fish with scales like silver and gold
swam after the boat, sometimes making a spring
and splashing the water round them; while birds,
red and blue, small and great, flew after him in
two long lines. The gnats danced round them,
and the cockchafers cried "Buzz, buzz." They all
wanted to follow Hjalmar, and all had some story
to tell him. It was a most delightful sail.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 338px;">
<img src="images/p151i.png" width="338" height="500" alt="On the balconies stood princesses." title="" />
</div>

<p>Sometimes the forests were thick and dark, sometimes
like a beautiful garden gay with sunshine
and flowers; he passed great palaces of glass and
of marble, and on the balconies stood princesses,
whose faces were those of little girls whom Hjalmar
knew well and had often played with. One
of the little girls held out her hand, in which was
a heart made of sugar, more beautiful than any
confectioner ever sold. As Hjalmar sailed by he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
caught hold of one side of the sugar heart and
held it fast, and the princess held fast too, so that
it broke in two pieces. Hjalmar had one piece and
the princess the other, but Hjalmar's was the larger.</p>

<p>At each castle stood little princes acting as
sentinels. They presented arms and had golden
swords and made it rain plums and tin soldiers,
so that they must have been real princes.</p>

<p>Hjalmar continued to sail, sometimes through
woods, sometimes as it were through large halls,
and then by large cities. At last he came to the
town where his nurse lived, who had carried him
in her arms when he was a very little boy and
had always been kind to him. She nodded and
beckoned to him and then sang the little verses
she had herself composed and sent to him:</p>

<div class='poem'>
How many, many hours I think on thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My own dear Hjalmar, still my pride and joy!</span><br />
How have I hung delighted over thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kissing thy rosy cheeks, my darling boy!</span><br />
<br />
Thy first low accents it was mine to hear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To-day my farewell words to thee shall fly.</span><br />
Oh, may the Lord thy shield be ever near<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fit thee for a mansion in the sky!</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>And all the birds sang the same tune, the flowers
danced on their stems, and the old trees nodded
as if Ole-Luk-Oie had been telling them stories,
as well.</div>


<div class='center'><br />WEDNESDAY</div>

<p>How the rain did pour down! Hjalmar could
hear it in his sleep, and when Ole-Luk-Oie
opened the window the water flowed quite up
to the window sill. It had the appearance of a
large lake outside, and a beautiful ship lay close
to the house.</p>

<p>"Wilt thou sail with me to-night, little Hjalmar?"
said Ole-Luk-Oie. "Then we shall see
foreign countries, and thou shalt return here in
the morning."</p>

<p>All in a moment there stood Hjalmar, in his
best clothes, on the deck of the noble ship, and
immediately the weather became fine.</p>

<p>They sailed through the streets, round by the
church, while on every side rolled the wide,
great sea.</p>

<p>They sailed till the land disappeared, and then
they saw a flock of storks who had left their own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
country and were traveling to warmer climates.
The storks flew one behind another and had
already been a long, long time on the wing.</p>

<p>One of them seemed so tired that his wings
could scarcely carry him. He was soon left very
far behind. At length he sank lower and lower,
with outstretched wings, flapping them in vain,
till his feet touched the rigging of the ship, and
he slid from the sails to the deck and stood
before them. Then a sailor boy caught him and
put him in the henhouse with the fowls, the
ducks, and the turkeys, while the poor stork
stood quite bewildered among them.</p>

<p>"Just look at that fellow," said the chickens.</p>

<p>Then the turkey cock puffed himself out as
large as he could and inquired who he was, and
the ducks waddled backwards, crying, "Quack,
quack!"</p>

<p>The stork told them all about warm Africa&mdash;of
the pyramids and of the ostrich, which, like a
wild horse, runs across the desert. But the ducks
did not understand what he said, and quacked
amongst themselves, "We are all of the same
opinion; namely, that he is stupid."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure, he is stupid," said the turkey
cock, and gobbled.</p>

<p>Then the stork remained quite silent and
thought of his home in Africa.</p>

<p>"Those are handsome thin legs of yours," said
the turkey cock. "What do they cost a yard?"</p>

<p>"Quack, quack, quack," grinned the ducks;
but the stork pretended not to hear.</p>

<p>"You may as well laugh," said the turkey,
"for that remark was rather witty, but perhaps
it was above you. Ah, ah, is he not clever? He
will be a great amusement to us while he remains
here." And then he gobbled, and the ducks
quacked: "Gobble, gobble"; "Quack, quack!"</p>

<p>What a terrible uproar they made while they
were having such fun among themselves!</p>

<p>Then Hjalmar went to the henhouse and,
opening the door, called to the stork. He hopped
out on the deck. He had rested himself now,
and he looked happy and seemed as if he nodded
to Hjalmar as if to thank him. Then he spread
his wings and flew away to warmer countries,
while the hens clucked, the ducks quacked, and
the turkey cock's head turned quite scarlet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"To-morrow you shall be made into soup," said
Hjalmar to the fowls; and then he awoke and
found himself lying in his little bed.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful journey which Ole-Luk-Oie
had made him take this night.</p>


<div class='center'><br />THURSDAY</div>

<p>"What do you think I have here?" said the
Dream Man. "Do not be frightened, and you
shall see a little mouse." And then he held out
his hand, in which lay a lovely little creature.
"It has come to invite you to a wedding. Two
little mice are going to be married to-night.
They live under the floor of your mother's
storeroom, and that must be a fine dwelling
place."</p>

<p>"But how can I get through the little mouse-hole
in the floor?" asked the little boy.</p>

<p>"Leave me to manage that," said the Dream
Man. "I will soon make you small enough."
And then he touched the boy with his magic
wand, upon which he became smaller and smaller
until at last he was no longer than a little finger.
"Now you can borrow the dress of your tin soldier.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
I think it will just fit you. It looks well to wear
a uniform when you go into company."</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," said the boy, and in a moment
he was dressed as neatly as the neatest of
all tin soldiers.</p>

<p>"Will you be so good as to seat yourself in
your mamma's thimble," said the little mouse,
"that I may have the pleasure of drawing you
to the wedding?"</p>

<p>"Will you really take so much trouble, young
lady?" said he. And so in this way he rode to
the mouse's wedding.</p>

<p>First they went under the floor, and then
through a long passage which was scarcely high
enough to allow the thimble to drive under, and
the whole passage was lit up with the light of
rotten wood.</p>

<p>"Does it not smell delicious?" asked the mouse,
as she drew him along. "The wall and the floor
have been smeared with bacon rind; nothing could
be nicer."</p>

<p>Very soon they arrived at the bridal hall.
On the right stood all the little lady mice, whispering
and giggling as if they were making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
game of each other. To the left were the gentlemen
mice, stroking their whiskers with their
forepaws. And in the center of the hall could be
seen the bridal pair, standing side by side in a
hollow cheese rind and kissing each other while
all eyes were upon them.</p>

<p>More and more friends kept coming, till the
mice were in danger of treading each other to
death; for the bridal pair now stood in the doorway,
and none could pass in or out.</p>

<p>The room had been rubbed over with bacon
rind like the passage, which was all the refreshment
offered to the guests. But for dessert a
pea was passed around, on which a mouse had
bitten the first letters of the names of the betrothed
pair. This was something quite uncommon.
All the mice said it was a very beautiful
wedding, and that they had been very agreeably
entertained.</p>

<p>After this Hjalmar returned home. He had
certainly been in grand society, but he had been
obliged to creep under a room and to make
himself small enough to wear the uniform of a
tin soldier.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />FRIDAY</div>

<p>"It is incredible how many old people there
are who would be glad to have me at night,"
said Ole-Luk-Oie, "especially those who have
done something wrong.</p>

<p>"'Good old Ole,' say they to me, 'we cannot
close our eyes, and we lie awake the whole night
and see all our evil deeds sitting on our beds like
little imps and sprinkling us with scalding water.
Will you come and drive them away, that we may
have a good night's rest?' and then they sigh so
deeply and say: 'We would gladly pay you for
it. Good night, Ole-Luk, the money lies in the
window.' But I never do anything for gold."</p>

<p>"What shall we do to-night?" asked Hjalmar.</p>

<p>"I do not know whether you would care to
go to another wedding," replied Ole-Luk-Oie,
"although it is quite a different affair from the
one we saw last night. Your sister's large doll,
that is dressed like a man and is called Herman,
intends to marry the doll Bertha. It is
also the dolls' birthday, and they will receive
many presents."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I know that already," said Hjalmar; "my
sister always allows her dolls to keep their birthdays
or to have a wedding when they require new
clothes. That has happened already a hundred
times, I am quite sure."</p>

<p>"Yes, so it may; but to-night is the hundred-and-first
wedding, and when that has taken place
it must be the last; therefore this is to be extremely
beautiful. Only look."</p>

<p>Hjalmar looked at the table, and there stood
the little cardboard dolls' house, with lights in all
the windows, and drawn up before it were the tin
soldiers, presenting arms.</p>

<p>The bridal pair were seated on the floor, leaning
against the leg of the table, looking very thoughtful
and with good reason. Then Ole-Luk-Oie, dressed
up in grandmother's black gown, married them.</p>

<p>As soon as the ceremony was concluded all the
furniture in the room joined in singing a beautiful
song which had been composed by the lead pencil,
and which went to the melody of a military tattoo:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Waft, gentle breeze, our kind farewell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To the tiny house where the bride folks dwell.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With their skin of kid leather fitting so well,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They are straight and upright as a tailor's ell.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hurrah! hurrah! for beau and belle.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Let echo repeat our kind farewell."</span><br />
</div>

<p>And now came the presents; but the bridal
pair had nothing to eat, for love was to be their
food.</p>

<p>"Shall we go to a country house, or travel?"
asked the bridegroom.</p>

<p>They consulted the swallow, who had traveled
so far, and the old hen in the yard, who had
brought up five broods of chickens.</p>

<p>And the swallow talked to them of warm countries
where the grapes hang in large clusters on
the vines and the air is soft and mild, and about
the mountains glowing with colors more beautiful
than we can think of.</p>

<p>"But they have no red cabbage such as we
have," said the hen. "I was once in the country
with my chickens for a whole summer. There
was a large sand pit in which we could walk
about and scratch as we liked. Then we got
into a garden in which grew red cabbage. Oh,
how nice it was! I cannot think of anything
more delicious."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"But one cabbage stalk is exactly like another,"
said the swallow; "and here we often have bad
weather."</p>

<p>"Yes, but we are accustomed to it," said the
hen.</p>

<p>"But it is so cold here, and freezes sometimes."</p>

<p>"Cold weather is good for cabbages," said the
hen; "besides, we do have it warm here sometimes.
Four years ago we had a summer that
lasted more than five weeks, and it was so hot one
could scarcely breathe. And then in this country
we have no poisonous animals, and we are free
from robbers. He must be a blockhead, who does
not consider our country the finest of all lands.
He ought not to be allowed to live here." And
then the hen wept very much and said: "I have
also traveled. I once went twelve miles in a coop,
and it was not pleasant traveling at all."</p>

<p>"The hen is a sensible woman," said the doll
Bertha. "I don't care for traveling over mountains,
just to go up and come down again. No,
let us go to the sand pit in front of the gate
and then take a walk in the cabbage garden."</p>

<p>And so they settled it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />SATURDAY</div>

<p>"Am I to hear any more stories?" asked little
Hjalmar, as soon as Ole-Luk-Oie had sent him
to sleep.</p>

<p>"We shall have no time this evening," said he,
spreading out his prettiest umbrella over the child.
"Look at these Chinese people." And then the
whole umbrella appeared like a large china bowl,
with blue trees and pointed bridges upon which
stood little Chinamen nodding their heads.</p>

<p>"We must make all the world beautiful for to-morrow
morning," said Ole-Luk-Oie, "for it will
be a holiday; it is Sunday. I must now go to the
church steeple and see if the little sprites who live
there have polished the bells so that they may
sound sweetly; then I must go into the fields
and see if the wind has blown the dust from the
grass and the leaves; and the most difficult task
of all which I have to do is to take down all the
stars and brighten them up. I have to number
them first before I put them in my apron, and also
to number the places from which I take them, so
that they may go back into the right holes, or else<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
they would not remain and we should have a
number of falling stars, for they would all tumble
down one after another."</p>

<p>"Hark ye, Mr. Luk-Oie!" said an old portrait
which hung on the wall of Hjalmar's bedroom.
"Do you know me? I am Hjalmar's great-grandfather.
I thank you for telling the boy
stories, but you must not confuse his ideas. The
stars cannot be taken down from the sky and
polished; they are spheres like our earth, which
is a good thing for them."</p>

<p>"Thank you, old great-grandfather," said Ole-Luk-Oie.
"I thank you. You may be the head
of the family, as no doubt you are, and very old,
but I am older still. I am an ancient heathen.
The old Romans and Greeks named me the
Dream God. I have visited the noblest houses,&mdash;yes,
and I continue to do so,&mdash;still I know how
to conduct myself both to high and low, and now
you may tell the stories yourself"; and so Ole-Luk-Oie
walked off, taking his umbrellas with him.</p>

<p>"Well, well, one is never to give an opinion,
I suppose," grumbled the portrait. And it woke
Hjalmar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />SUNDAY</div>

<p>"Good evening," said Ole-Luk-Oie.</p>

<p>Hjalmar nodded, and then sprang out of bed and
turned his great-grandfather's portrait to the wall
so that it might not interrupt them as it had done
yesterday. "Now," said he, "you must tell me some
stories about five green peas that lived in one pod,
or of the chickseed that courted the chickweed,
or of the Darning-needle who acted so proudly
because she fancied herself an embroidery needle."</p>

<p>"You may have too much of a good thing,"
said Ole-Luk-Oie. "You know that I like best
to show you something, so I will show you my
brother. He is also called Ole-Luk-Oie, but he
never visits any one but once, and when he does
come he takes him away on his horse and tells
him stories as they ride along.</p>

<p>"He knows only two stories. One of these is
so wonderfully beautiful that no one in the world
can imagine anything at all like it, but the other
it would be impossible to describe."</p>

<p>Then Ole-Luk-Oie lifted Hjalmar up to the
window. "There, now you can see my brother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the other Ole-Luk-Oie; he is also called Death.
You see he is not so bad as they represent him in
picture books. There he is a skeleton, but here
his coat is embroidered with silver, and he wears
the splendid uniform of a hussar, and a mantle
of black velvet flies behind him over the horse.
Look, how he gallops along."</p>

<p>Hjalmar saw that as this Ole-Luk-Oie rode
on he lifted up old and young and carried them
away on his horse. Some he seated in front of
him and some behind, but always inquired first,
"How stands the record book?"</p>

<p>"Good," they all answered.</p>

<p>"Yes, but let me see for myself," he replied,
and they were obliged to give him the books.
Then all those who had "Very good" or "Exceedingly
good" came in front of the horse and heard
the beautiful story, while those who had "Middling"
or "Fairly good" in their books were
obliged to sit behind. They cried and wanted to
jump down from the horse, but they could not
get free, for they seemed fastened to the seat.</p>

<p>"Why, Death is a most splendid Luk-Oie," said
Hjalmar. "I am not in the least afraid of him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"You need have no fear of him," said Ole-Luk-Oie;
"but take care and keep a good conduct
book."</p>

<p>"Now I call that very instructive," murmured
the great-grandfather's portrait. "It is useful
sometimes to express an opinion." So he was
quite satisfied.</p>

<p>These are some of the doings and sayings of
Ole-Luk-Oie. I hope he may visit you himself
this evening and relate some more.</p>

<img src="images/p169i.png" width="450" height="179" alt="The Money Box" title="" />
</div>


<h2>THE MONEY BOX</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 38px;"><img src="images/drop-i.png" width="38" height="100" alt="I" title="" /></div><div class='unindent'>N a nursery where a number of toys lay
scattered about, a money box stood on the top
of a very high wardrobe. It was made of clay
in the shape of a pig and had been bought of the
potter. In the back of the pig was a slit, and this
slit had been enlarged with a knife so that dollars,
or even crown pieces, might slip through&mdash;and indeed
there were two in the box, besides a number
of pence. The money-pig was stuffed so full that
it could no longer rattle, which is the highest state
of perfectness to which a money-pig can attain.</div>

<p>There he stood upon the cupboard, high and
lofty, looking down upon everything else in the
room. He knew very well that he had enough
inside himself to buy up all the other toys, and
this gave him a very good opinion of his own value.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>The rest thought of this fact also, although
they did not express it, there were so many
other things to talk about. A large doll, still
handsome (though rather old, for her neck had
been mended) lay inside one of the drawers, which
was partly open. She called out to the others,
"Let us have a game at being men and women;
that is something worth playing at."</p>

<p>Upon this there was a great uproar; even the
engravings which hung in frames on the wall
turned round in their excitement and showed that
they had a wrong side to them, although they
had not the least intention of exposing themselves
in this way or of objecting to the game.</p>

<p>It was late at night, but as the moon shone
through the windows, they had light at a cheap
rate. And as the game was now to begin, all were
invited to take part in it, even the children's
wagon, which certainly belonged among the
coarser playthings. "Each has its own value,"
said the wagon; "we cannot all be noblemen;
there must be some to do the work."</p>

<p>The money-pig was the only one who received
a written invitation. He stood so high that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
were afraid he would not accept a verbal message.
But in his reply he said if he had to take a part
he must enjoy the sport from his own home; they
were to arrange for him to do so. And so they did.</p>

<p>The little toy theater was therefore put up in
such a way that the money-pig could look directly
into it. Some wanted to begin with a comedy
and afterwards to have a tea party and a discussion
for mental improvement, but they began
with the latter first.</p>

<p>The rocking-horse spoke of training and races;
the wagon, of railways and steam power&mdash;for these
subjects belonged to each of their professions,
and it was right they should talk of them. The
clock talked politics&mdash;"Tick, tick." He professed
to know what was the time of the day, but there
was a whisper that he did not go correctly.
The bamboo cane stood by, looking stiff and
proud (he was vain of his brass ferrule and silver
top), and on the sofa lay two worked cushions,
pretty but stupid.</p>

<p>When the play at the little theater began, the
rest sat and looked on; they were requested to
applaud and stamp, or crack, whenever they felt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
gratified with what they saw. The riding whip
said he never cracked for old people, only for
the young&mdash;those who were not yet married.
"I crack for everybody," said the nutcracker.</p>

<p>"Yes, and a fine noise you make," thought the
audience as the play went on.</p>

<p>It was not worth much, but it was very well
played, and all the actors turned their painted sides
to the audience, for they were made to be seen
only on one side. The acting was wonderful, excepting
that sometimes the actors came out beyond
the lamps, because the wires were a little too long.</p>

<p>The doll whose neck had been mended was
so excited that the place in her neck burst, and
the money-pig declared he must do something
for one of the players as they had all pleased
him so much. So he made up his mind to mention
one of them in his will as the one to be
buried with him in the family vault, whenever
that event should happen.</p>

<p>They enjoyed the comedy so much that they
gave up all thoughts of the tea party and only
carried out their idea of intellectual amusement,
which they called playing at men and women.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
And there was nothing wrong about it, for it
was only play. All the while each one thought
most of himself or of what the money-pig could
be thinking. The money-pig's thoughts were on
(as he supposed) a very far-distant time&mdash;of
making his will, and of his burial, and of when
it might all come to pass.</p>

<p>Certainly sooner than he expected; for all at
once down he came from the top of the press,
fell on the floor, and was broken to pieces.
Then all the pennies hopped and danced about
in the most amusing manner. The little ones
twirled round like tops, and the large ones rolled
away as far as they could, especially the one
great silver crown piece, who had often wanted
to go out into the world. And he had his wish as
well as all the rest of the money. The pieces
of the money-pig were thrown into the dustbin,
and the next day there stood a new money-pig
on the cupboard, but it had not a farthing inside
it yet, and therefore, like the old one, could
not rattle.</p>

<p>This was the beginning with him, and with
us it shall be the end of our story.</p>

<h2>ELDER-TREE MOTHER</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;"><img src="images/drop-t.png" width="83" height="100" alt="T" title="" /></div><div class='unindent'>HERE was once a little boy who had
taken cold by going out and getting his
feet wet. No one could think how he had
managed to do so, for the weather was quite
dry. His mother undressed him and put him
to bed, and then she brought in the teapot to
make him a good cup of elder tea, which is so
warming.</div>

<p>At the same time the friendly old man who
lived all alone at the top of the house came in
at the door. He had neither wife nor child, but
he was very fond of children and knew so many
fairy tales and stories that it was a pleasure to
hear him talk. "Now, if you drink your tea,"
said the mother, "very likely you will have a
story in the meantime."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 338px;">

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, if I could think of a new one to tell,"
said the old man. "But how did the little fellow
get his feet wet?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the mother, "that is what we cannot
make out."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me a story?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you can tell me exactly how deep the
gutter is in the little street through which you
go to school."</p>

<p>"Just halfway up to my knee," said the boy,
promptly; "that is, if I stand in the deepest
part."</p>

<p>"It is easy to see how we got our feet wet,"
said the old man. "Well, now I suppose I ought
to tell a story, but really I don't know any more."</p>

<p>"You can make up one, I know," said the boy.
"Mother says that you can turn everything you
look at into a story, and everything, even, that
you touch."</p>

<p>"Ah, but those tales and stories are worth
nothing. The real ones come of themselves; they
knock at my forehead and say, 'Here we are!'"</p>

<p>"Won't there be a knock soon?" asked the boy.
And his mother laughed as she put elder flowers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
in the teapot and poured boiling water over them.
"Oh, do tell me a story."</p>

<p>"Yes, if a story comes of itself, but tales and
stories are very grand; they only come when it
pleases them. Stop," he cried all at once, "here
we have it; look! there is a story in the teapot
now."</p>

<p>The little boy looked at the teapot and saw
the lid raise itself gradually and long branches
stretch out, even from the spout, in all directions
till they became larger and larger, and there
appeared a great elder tree covered with flowers
white and fresh. It spread itself even to the
bed and pushed the curtains aside, and oh, how
fragrant the blossoms were!</p>

<p>In the midst of the tree sat a pleasant-looking
old woman in a very strange dress. The dress
was green, like the leaves of the elder tree, and
was decorated with large white elder blossoms.
It was not easy to tell whether the border was
made of some kind of stuff or of real flowers.</p>

<p>"What is that woman's name?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"The Romans and Greeks called her a dryad,"
said the old man, "but we do not understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
that name; we have a better one for her in the
quarter of the town where the sailors live. They
call her Elder-flower Mother, and you must pay
attention to her now, and listen while you look
at the beautiful tree.</p>

<p>"Just such a large, blooming tree as this stands
outside in the corner of a poor little yard, and
under this tree, one bright sunny afternoon, sat
two old people, a sailor and his wife. They had
great-grandchildren, and would soon celebrate the
golden wedding, which is the fiftieth anniversary
of the wedding day in many countries, and
the Elder Mother sat in the tree and looked as
pleased as she does now.</p>

<p>"'I know when the golden wedding is to be,'
said she, but they did not hear her; they were
talking of olden times. 'Do you remember,' said
the old sailor, 'when we were quite little and
used to run about and play in the very same yard
where we are now sitting, and how we planted
little twigs in one corner and made a garden?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said the old woman, 'I remember it
quite well; and how we watered the twigs, and
one of them was a sprig of elder that took root<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and put forth green shoots, until in time it became
the great tree under which we old people
are now seated.'</p>

<p>"'To be sure,' he replied, 'and in that corner
yonder stands the water butt in which I used to
swim my boat that I had cut out all myself; and
it sailed well too. But since then I have learned
a very different kind of sailing.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, but before that we went to school,' said
she, 'and then we were prepared for confirmation.
How we both cried on that day! But in
the afternoon we went hand in hand up to the
round tower and saw the view over Copenhagen
and across the water; then we went to Fredericksburg,
where the king and queen were sailing
in their beautiful boat on the canals.'</p>

<p>"'But I had to sail on a very different voyage
elsewhere and be away from home for years on
long voyages,' said the old sailor.</p>

<p>"'Ah yes, and I used to cry about you,' said
she, 'for I thought you must be lying drowned
at the bottom of the sea, with the waves sweeping
over you. And many a time have I got up
in the night to see if the weathercock had turned;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
it turned often enough, but you came not. How
well I remember one day the rain was pouring
down from the skies, and the man came to the
house where I was in service to take away the
dust. I went down to him with the dust box and
stood for a moment at the door,&mdash;what shocking
weather it was!&mdash;and while I stood there
the postman came up and brought me a letter
from you.</p>

<p>"'How that letter had traveled about! I tore
it open and read it. I laughed and wept at the
same time, I was so happy. It said that you
were in warm countries where the coffee berries
grew, and what a beautiful country it was, and
described many other wonderful things. And so I
stood reading by the dustbin, with the rain pouring
down, when all at once somebody came and
clasped me round the waist.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, and you gave him such a box on the
ears that they tingled,' said the old man.</p>

<p>"'I did not know that it was you,' she replied;
'but you had arrived as quickly as your letter, and
you looked so handsome, and, indeed, so you are
still. You had a large yellow silk handkerchief in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
your pocket and a shiny hat on your head. You
looked quite fine. And all the time what weather
it was, and how dismal the street looked!'</p>

<p>"'And then do you remember,' said he, 'when
we were married, and our first boy came, and then
Marie, and Niels, and Peter, and Hans Christian?'</p>

<p>"'Indeed I do,' she replied; 'and they are all
grown up respectable men and women, whom
every one likes.'</p>

<p>"'And now their children have little ones,' said
the old sailor. 'There are great-grandchildren for
us, strong and healthy too. Was it not about
this time of year that we were married?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, and to-day is the golden-wedding day,'
said Elder-tree Mother, popping her head out just
between the two old people; and they thought
it was a neighbor nodding to them. Then they
looked at each other and clasped their hands together.
Presently came their children and grand*-children,
who knew very well that it was the
golden-wedding day. They had already wished
them joy on that very morning, but the old people
had forgotten it, although they remembered
so well all that had happened many years before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
And the elder tree smelled sweet, and the setting
sun shone upon the faces of the old people till
they looked quite ruddy. And the youngest of
their grandchildren danced round them joyfully,
and said they were going to have a feast in the
evening, and there were to be hot potatoes. Then
the Elder Mother nodded in the tree and cried
'Hurrah!' with all the rest."</p>

<p>"But that is not a story," said the little boy
who had been listening.</p>

<p>"Not till you understand it," said the old man.
"But let us ask the Elder Mother to explain it."</p>

<p>"It was not exactly a story," said the Elder
Mother, "but the story is coming now, and it is
a true one. For out of truth the most wonderful
stories grow, just as my beautiful elder bush has
sprung out of the teapot." And then she took
the little boy out of bed and laid him on her
bosom, and the blooming branches of elder closed
over them so that they sat, as it were, in a leafy
bower, and the bower flew with them through
the air in the most delightful manner.</p>

<p>Then the Elder Mother all at once changed to
a beautiful young maiden, but her dress was still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
of the same green stuff, ornamented with a border
of white elder blossoms such as the Elder
Mother had worn. In her bosom she wore a real
elder flower, and a wreath of the same was entwined
in her golden ringlets. Her large blue
eyes were very beautiful to look at. She was of
the same age as the boy, and they kissed each
other and felt very happy.</p>

<p>They left the arbor together, hand in hand,
and found themselves in a beautiful flower garden
which belonged to their home. On the green
lawn their father's stick was tied up. There was
life in this stick for the little ones, for no sooner
did they place themselves upon it than the white
knob changed into a pretty neighing head with
a black, flowing mane, and four long, slender legs
sprung forth. The creature was strong and spirited,
and galloped with them round the grassplot.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! now we will ride many miles away,"
said the boy; "we'll ride to the nobleman's estate,
where we went last year."</p>

<p>Then they rode round the grassplot again, and
the little maiden, who, we know, was Elder-tree
Mother, kept crying out: "Now we are in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
country. Do you see the farmhouse, with a great
baking oven standing out from the wall by the road-side
like a gigantic egg? There is an elder spreading
its branches over it, and a cock is marching about
and scratching for the chickens. See how he struts!</p>

<p>"Now we are near the church. There it stands
on the hill, shaded by the great oak trees, one of
which is half dead. See, here we are at the blacksmith's
forge. How the fire burns! And the
half-clad men are striking the hot iron with the
hammer, so that the sparks fly about. Now then,
away to the nobleman's beautiful estate!" And
the boy saw all that the little girl spoke of as she
sat behind him on the stick, for it passed before
him although they were only galloping round the
grassplot. Then they played together in a side
walk and raked up the earth to make a little
garden. Then she took elder flowers out of her
hair and planted them, and they grew just like
those which he had heard the old people talking
about, and which they had planted in their young
days. They walked about hand in hand too, just
as the old people had done when they were children,
but they did not go up the round tower nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to Fredericksburg garden. No; but the little girl
seized the boy round the waist, and they rode
all over the whole country (sometimes it was
spring, then summer; then autumn and winter
followed), while thousands of images were presented
to the boy's eyes and heart, and the little
girl constantly sang to him, "You must never
forget all this." And through their whole flight
the elder tree sent forth the sweetest fragrance.</p>

<p>They passed roses and fresh beech trees, but
the perfume of the elder tree was stronger than
all, for its flowers hung round the little maiden's
heart, against which the boy so often leaned his
head during their flight.</p>

<p>"It is beautiful here in the spring," said the
maiden, as they stood in a grove of beech trees
covered with fresh green leaves, while at their
feet the sweet-scented thyme and blushing anemone
lay spread amid the green grass in delicate
bloom. "O that it were always spring in the
fragrant beech groves!"</p>

<p>"Here it is delightful in summer," said the
maiden, as they passed old knights' castles telling
of days gone by and saw the high walls and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
pointed gables mirrored in the rivers beneath,
where swans were sailing about and peeping into
the cool green avenues. In the fields the corn
waved to and fro like the sea. Red and yellow
flowers grew amongst the ruins, and the hedges
were covered with wild hops and blooming convolvulus.
In the evening the moon rose round
and full, and the haystacks in the meadows filled
the air with their sweet scent. These were scenes
never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>"It is lovely here also in autumn," said the
little maiden, and then the scene changed again.
The sky appeared higher and more beautifully
blue, while the forest glowed with colors of red,
green, and gold. The hounds were off to the
chase, and large flocks of wild birds flew screaming
over the Huns' graves, where the blackberry
bushes twined round the old ruins. The dark
blue sea was dotted with white sails, and in the
barns sat old women, maidens, and children picking
hops into a large tub. The young ones sang
songs, and the old ones told fairy tales of wizards
and witches. There could be nothing more
pleasant than all this.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Again," said the maiden, "it is beautiful here
in winter." Then in a moment all the trees were
covered with hoarfrost, so that they looked like
white coral. The snow crackled beneath the feet
as if every one had on new boots, and one shooting
star after another fell from the sky. In warm
rooms there could be seen the Christmas trees,
decked out with presents and lighted up amid
festivities and joy. In the country farmhouses
could be heard the sound of a violin, and there
were games for apples, so that even the poorest
child could say, "It is beautiful in winter."</p>

<p>And beautiful indeed were all the scenes which
the maiden showed to the little boy, and always
around them floated the fragrance of the elder
blossom, and ever above them waved the red flag
with the white cross, under which the old seaman
had sailed. The boy&mdash;who had become a youth,
and who had gone as a sailor out into the wide
world and sailed to warm countries where the
coffee grew, and to whom the little girl had given
an elder blossom from her bosom for a keepsake,
when she took leave of him&mdash;placed the flower
in his hymn book; and when he opened it in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
foreign lands he always turned to the spot where
this flower of remembrance lay, and the more he
looked at it the fresher it appeared. He could,
as it were, breathe the homelike fragrance of
the woods, and see the little girl looking at him
from between the petals of the flower with her
clear blue eyes, and hear her whispering, "It is
beautiful here at home in spring and summer, in
autumn and in winter," while hundreds of these
home scenes passed through his memory.</p>

<p>Many years had passed, and he was now an old
man, seated with his old wife under an elder tree
in full blossom. They were holding each other's
hands, just as the great-grandfather and grandmother
had done, and spoke, as they did, of olden
times and of the golden wedding. The little
maiden with the blue eyes and with the elder
blossoms in her hair sat in the tree and nodded
to them and said, "To-day is the golden wedding."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 338px;">
<img src="images/p189i.png" width="338" height="500" alt="As she placed them on the heads of the old people, each flower became a golden crown." title="" />
</div>

<p>And then she took two flowers out of her wreath
and kissed them, and they shone first like silver
and then like gold, and as she placed them on
the heads of the old people, each flower became a
golden crown. And there they sat like a king and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
queen under the sweet-scented tree, which still
looked like an elder bush. Then he related to his
old wife the story of the Elder-tree Mother, just
as he had heard it told when he was a little boy,
and they both fancied it very much like their
own story, especially in parts which they liked
the best.</p>

<p>"Well, and so it is," said the little maiden in
the tree. "Some call me Elder Mother, others a
dryad, but my real name is Memory. It is I who
sit in the tree as it grows and grows, and I can
think of the past and relate many things. Let
me see if you have still preserved the flower."</p>

<p>Then the old man opened his hymn book, and
there lay the elder flower, as fresh as if it had only
just been placed there, and Memory nodded.
And the two old people with the golden crowns
on their heads sat in the red glow of the evening
sunlight and closed their eyes, and&mdash;and&mdash;the
story was ended.</p>

<p>The little boy lay in his bed and did not quite
know whether he had been dreaming or listening
to a story. The teapot stood on the table, but no
elder bush grew out of it, and the old man who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
had really told the tale was on the threshold and
just going out at the door.</p>

<p>"How beautiful it was," said the little boy.
"Mother, I have been to warm countries."</p>

<p>"I can quite believe it," said his mother.
"When any one drinks two full cups of elder-flower
tea, he may well get into warm countries"; and
then she covered him up, that he should not take
cold. "You have slept well while I have been
disputing with the old man as to whether it was
a real story or a fairy legend."</p>

<p>"And where is the Elder-tree Mother?" asked
the boy.</p>

<p>"She is in the teapot," said the mother, "and
there she may stay."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 105px;"><img src="images/drop-y.png" width="105" height="100" alt="Y" title="" /></div><div class='unindent'>OU must attend to the beginning of
this story, for when we get to the end
we shall know more than we now do
about a very wicked hobgoblin; he was one of
the most mischievous of all sprites, for he was
a real demon.</div>

<p>One day when he was in a merry mood he
made a looking-glass which had the power of
making everything good or beautiful that was reflected
in it shrink almost to nothing, while everything
that was worthless and bad was magnified
so as to look ten times worse than it really was.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>The most lovely landscapes appeared like boiled
spinach, and all the people became hideous and
looked as if they stood on their heads and had
no bodies. Their countenances were so distorted
that no one could recognize them, and even one
freckle on the face appeared to spread over the
whole of the nose and mouth. The demon said
this was very amusing. When a good or holy
thought passed through the mind of any one a
wrinkle was seen in the mirror, and then how
the demon laughed at his cunning invention.</p>

<p>All who went to the demon's school&mdash;for he
kept a school&mdash;talked everywhere of the wonders
they had seen, and declared that people could
now, for the first time, see what the world and
its inhabitants were really like. They carried the
glass about everywhere, till at last there was not
a land nor a people who had not been looked at
through this distorted mirror.</p>

<p>They wanted even to fly with it up to heaven
to see the angels, but the higher they flew the more
slippery the glass became, and they could scarcely
hold it. At last it slipped from their hands, fell to
the earth, and was broken into millions of pieces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>But now the looking-glass caused more unhappiness
than ever, for some of the fragments were
not so large as a grain of sand, and they flew
about the world into every country. And when one
of these tiny atoms flew into a person's eye it stuck
there, unknown to himself, and from that moment
he viewed everything the wrong way, and could
see only the worst side of what he looked at,
for even the smallest fragment retained the same
power which had belonged to the whole mirror.</p>

<p>Some few persons even got a splinter of the
looking-glass in their hearts, and this was terrible,
for their hearts became cold and hard like a lump
of ice. A few of the pieces were so large that
they could be used as windowpanes; it would
have been a sad thing indeed to look at our
friends through them. Other pieces were made
into spectacles, and this was dreadful, for those
who wore them could see nothing either rightly
or justly. At all this the wicked demon laughed
till his sides shook, to see the mischief he had
done. There are still a number of these little fragments
of glass floating about in the air, and now
you shall hear what happened with one of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>


<h3>SECOND STORY</h3>

<div class='center'>A LITTLE BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL</div>

<p>In a large town full of houses and people there
is not room for everybody to have even a little
garden. Most people are obliged to content themselves
with a few flowers in flowerpots.</p>

<p>In one of these large towns lived two poor
children who had a garden somewhat larger and
better than a few flowerpots. They were not
brother and sister, but they loved each other
almost as much as if they had been. Their
parents lived opposite each other in two garrets
where the roofs of neighboring houses nearly
joined each other, and the water pipe ran between
them. In each roof was a little window, so that
any one could step across the gutter from one
window to the other.</p>

<p>The parents of each of these children had a
large wooden box in which they cultivated kitchen
vegetables for their own use, and in each box was
a little rosebush which grew luxuriantly.</p>

<p>After a while the parents decided to place these
two boxes across the water pipe, so that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
reached from one window to the other and looked
like two banks of flowers. Sweet peas drooped
over the boxes, and the rosebushes shot forth long
branches, which were trained about the windows
and clustered together almost like a triumphal
arch of leaves and flowers.</p>

<p>The boxes were very high, and the children
knew they must not climb upon them without
permission; but they often had leave to step out
and sit upon their little stools under the rosebushes
or play quietly together.</p>

<p>In winter all this pleasure came to an end, for
the windows were sometimes quite frozen over.
But they would warm copper pennies on the stove
and hold the warm pennies against the frozen
pane; then there would soon be a little round hole
through which they could peep, and the soft, bright
eyes of the little boy and girl would sparkle
through the hole at each window as they looked
at each other. Their names were Kay and Gerda.
In summer they could be together with one jump
from the window, but in winter they had to go
up and down the long staircase and out through
the snow before they could meet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"See! there are the white bees swarming," said
Kay's old grandmother one day when it was
snowing.</p>

<p>"Have they a queen bee?" asked the little boy,
for he knew that the real bees always had a queen.</p>

<p>"To be sure they have," said the grandmother.
"She is flying there where the swarm is thickest.
She is the largest of them all and never remains
on the earth, but flies up to the dark clouds.
Often at midnight she flies through the streets
of the town and breathes with her frosty breath
upon the windows; then the ice freezes on the
panes into wonderful forms that look like flowers
and castles."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have seen them," said both the children;
and they knew it must be true.</p>

<p>"Can the Snow Queen come in here?" asked
the little girl.</p>

<p>"Only let her come," said the boy. "I'll put
her on the warm stove, and then she'll melt."</p>

<p>The grandmother smoothed his hair and told
him more stories.</p>

<p>That same evening when little Kay was at
home, half undressed, he climbed upon a chair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
by the window and peeped out through the little
round hole. A few flakes of snow were falling,
and one of them, rather larger than the rest,
alighted on the edge of one of the flower boxes.
Strange to say, this snowflake grew larger and
larger till at last it took the form of a woman
dressed in garments of white gauze, which looked
like millions of starry snowflakes linked together.
She was fair and beautiful, but made of ice&mdash;glittering,
dazzling ice. Still, she was alive, and
her eyes sparkled like bright stars, though there
was neither peace nor rest in them. She nodded
toward the window and waved her hand. The
little boy was frightened and sprang from the
chair, and at the same moment it seemed as if
a large bird flew by the window.</p>

<p>On the following day there was a clear frost,
and very soon came the spring. The sun shone;
the young green leaves burst forth; the swallows
built their nests; windows were opened, and the
children sat once more in the garden on the roof,
high above all the other rooms.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/p199i.png" width="336" height="500" alt="The children sat once more in the garden on the roof...." title="" />
</div>

<p>How beautifully the roses blossomed this summer!
The little girl had learned a hymn in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
roses were spoken of. She thought of their own
roses, and she sang the hymn to the little boy,
and he sang, too:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Roses bloom and fade away;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The Christ-child shall abide alway.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Blessed are we his face to see</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And ever little children be."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Then the little ones held each other by the hand,
and kissed the roses, and looked at the bright sunshine,
and spoke to it as if the Christ-child were
really there. Those were glorious summer days.
How beautiful and fresh it was out among the
rosebushes, which seemed as if they would never
leave off blooming.</div>

<p>One day Kay and Gerda sat looking at a book
of pictures of animals and birds. Just then, as
the clock in the church tower struck twelve, Kay
said, "Oh, something has struck my heart!" and
soon after, "There is certainly something in my
eye."</p>

<p>The little girl put her arm round his neck and
looked into his eye, but she could see nothing.</p>

<p>"I believe it is gone," he said. But it was not
gone; it was one of those bits of the looking-glass,&mdash;that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
magic mirror of which we have spoken,&mdash;the
ugly glass which made everything great and
good appear small and ugly, while all that was
wicked and bad became more visible, and every
little fault could be plainly seen. Poor little Kay
had also received a small splinter in his heart,
which very quickly turned to a lump of ice. He
felt no more pain, but the glass was there still.
"Why do you cry?" said he at last. "It makes
you look ugly. There is nothing the matter with
me now. Oh, fie!" he cried suddenly; "that rose
is worm-eaten, and this one is quite crooked.
After all, they are ugly roses, just like the box
in which they stand." And then he kicked the
boxes with his foot and pulled off the two roses.</p>

<p>"Why, Kay, what are you doing?" cried the little
girl; and then when he saw how grieved she
was he tore off another rose and jumped through
his own window, away from sweet little Gerda.</p>

<p>When afterward she brought out the picture
book he said, "It is only fit for babies in long
clothes," and when grandmother told stories he
would interrupt her with "but"; or sometimes
when he could manage it he would get behind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
her chair, put on a pair of spectacles, and imitate
her very cleverly to make the people laugh.
By and by he began to mimic the speech and gait
of persons in the street. All that was peculiar or
disagreeable in a person he would imitate directly,
and people said, "That boy will be very clever;
he has a remarkable genius." But it was the piece
of glass in his eye and the coldness in his heart
that made him act like this. He would even tease
little Gerda, who loved him with all her heart.</p>

<p>His games too were quite different; they were
not so childlike. One winter's day, when it
snowed, he brought out a burning glass, then,
holding out the skirt of his blue coat, let the
snowflakes fall upon it.</p>

<p>"Look in this glass, Gerda," said he, and she
saw how every flake of snow was magnified and
looked like a beautiful flower or a glittering star.</p>

<p>"Is it not clever," said Kay, "and much more
interesting than looking at real flowers? There
is not a single fault in it. The snowflakes are
quite perfect till they begin to melt."</p>

<p>Soon after, Kay made his appearance in large,
thick gloves and with his sledge at his back. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
called upstairs to Gerda, "I've got leave to go
into the great square, where the other boys play
and ride." And away he went.</p>

<p>In the great square the boldest among the
boys would often tie their sledges to the wagons
of the country people and so get a ride. This
was capital. But while they were all amusing
themselves, and Kay with them, a great sledge
came by; it was painted white, and in it sat
some one wrapped in a rough white fur and
wearing a white cap. The sledge drove twice
round the square, and Kay fastened his own
little sledge to it, so that when it went away
he went with it. It went faster and faster right
through the next street, and the person who
drove turned round and nodded pleasantly to
Kay as if they were well acquainted with each
other; but whenever Kay wished to loosen his
little sledge the driver turned and nodded as if
to signify that he was to stay, so Kay sat still,
and they drove out through the town gate.</p>

<p>Then the snow began to fall so heavily that
the little boy could not see a hand's breadth
before him, but still they drove on. He suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
loosened the cord so that the large sledge might
go on without him, but it was of no use; his
little carriage held fast, and away they went like
the wind. Then he called out loudly, but nobody
heard him, while the snow beat upon him,
and the sledge flew onward. Every now and then
it gave a jump, as if they were going over hedges
and ditches. The boy was frightened and tried
to say a prayer, but he could remember nothing
but the multiplication table.</p>

<p>The snowflakes became larger and larger, till
they appeared like great white birds. All at once
they sprang on one side, the great sledge stopped,
and the person who had driven it rose up. The
fur and the cap, which were made entirely of
snow, fell off, and he saw a lady, tall and white;
it was the Snow Queen.</p>

<p>"We have driven well," said she; "but why do
you tremble so? Here, creep into my warm fur."
Then she seated him beside her in the sledge,
and as she wrapped the fur about him, he felt
as if he were sinking into a snowdrift.</p>

<p>"Are you still cold?" she asked, as she kissed
him on the forehead. The kiss was colder than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
ice; it went quite through to his heart, which
was almost a lump of ice already. He felt as if
he were going to die, but only for a moment&mdash;he
soon seemed quite well and did not notice the
cold all around him.</p>

<p>"My sledge! Don't forget my sledge," was his
first thought, and then he looked and saw that
it was bound fast to one of the white birds which
flew behind him. The Snow Queen kissed little
Kay again, and by this time he had forgotten
little Gerda, his grandmother, and all at home.</p>

<p>"Now you must have no more kisses," she said,
"or I should kiss you to death."</p>

<p>Kay looked at her. She was so beautiful, he
could not imagine a more lovely face; she did not
now seem to be made of ice as when he had seen
her through his window and she had nodded to him.</p>

<p>In his eyes she was perfect, and he did not
feel at all afraid. He told her he could do mental
arithmetic as far as fractions, and that he knew
the number of square miles and the number of
inhabitants in the country. She smiled, and it
occurred to him that she thought he did not yet
know so very much.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked around the vast expanse as she flew
higher and higher with him upon a black cloud,
while the storm blew and howled as if it were
singing songs of olden time. They flew over
woods and lakes, over sea and land; below them
roared the wild wind; wolves howled, and the
snow crackled; over them flew the black, screaming
crows, and above all shone the moon, clear
and bright&mdash;and so Kay passed through the
long, long winter's night, and by day he slept at
the feet of the Snow Queen.</p>


<h3>THIRD STORY</h3>

<div class='center'>THE ENCHANTED FLOWER GARDEN</div>

<p>But how fared little Gerda in Kay's absence?</p>

<p>What had become of him no one knew, nor
could any one give the slightest information, excepting
the boys, who said that he had tied his
sledge to another very large one, which had driven
through the street and out at the town gate. No
one knew where it went. Many tears were shed
for him, and little Gerda wept bitterly for a long
time. She said she knew he must be dead, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
he was drowned in the river which flowed close
by the school. The long winter days were very
dreary. But at last spring came with warm
sunshine.</p>

<p>"Kay is dead and gone," said little Gerda.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," said the sunshine.</p>

<p>"He is dead and gone," she said to the sparrows.</p>

<p>"We don't believe it," they replied, and at last
little Gerda began to doubt it herself.</p>

<p>"I will put on my new red shoes," she said one
morning, "those that Kay has never seen, and
then I will go down to the river and ask for him."</p>

<p>It was quite early when she kissed her old
grandmother, who was still asleep; then she put
on her red shoes and went, quite alone, out of
the town gate, toward the river.</p>

<p>"Is it true that you have taken my little playmate
away from me?" she said to the river. "I
will give you my red shoes if you will give him
back to me."</p>

<p>And it seemed as if the waves nodded to her
in a strange manner. Then she took off her red
shoes, which she liked better than anything else,
and threw them both into the river, but they fell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
near the bank, and the little waves carried them
back to land just as if the river would not take
from her what she loved best, because it could
not give her back little Kay.</p>

<p>But she thought the shoes had not been thrown
out far enough. Then she crept into a boat that
lay among the reeds, and threw the shoes again
from the farther end of the boat into the water;
but it was not fastened, and her movement sent
it gliding away from the land. When she saw
this she hastened to reach the end of the boat,
but before she could do so it was more than a
yard from the bank and drifting away faster
than ever.</p>

<p>Little Gerda was very much frightened. She
began to cry, but no one heard her except the
sparrows, and they could not carry her to land,
but they flew along by the shore and sang as if
to comfort her: "Here we are! Here we are!"</p>

<p>The boat floated with the stream, and little
Gerda sat quite still with only her stockings on
her feet; the red shoes floated after her, but she
could not reach them because the boat kept so
much in advance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/p209i.png" width="336" height="500" alt="There came a very old woman out of the house" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>The banks on either side of the river were very
pretty. There were beautiful flowers, old trees,
sloping fields in which cows and sheep were
grazing, but not a human being to be seen.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the river will carry me to little Kay,"
thought Gerda, and then she became more cheerful,
and raised her head and looked at the beautiful
green banks; and so the boat sailed on for
hours. At length she came to a large cherry
orchard, in which stood a small house with
strange red and blue windows. It had also a
thatched roof, and outside were two wooden
soldiers that presented arms to her as she sailed
past. Gerda called out to them, for she thought
they were alive; but of course they did not
answer, and as the boat drifted nearer to the
shore she saw what they really were.</p>

<p>Then Gerda called still louder, and there came
a very old woman out of the house, leaning
on a crutch. She wore a large hat to shade her
from the sun, and on it were painted all sorts of
pretty flowers.</p>

<p>"You poor little child," said the old woman,
"how did you manage to come this long, long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
distance into the wide world on such a rapid,
rolling stream?" And then the old woman
walked into the water, seized the boat with her
crutch, drew it to land, and lifted little Gerda
out. And Gerda was glad to feel herself again
on dry ground, although she was rather afraid
of the strange old woman.</p>

<p>"Come and tell me who you are," said she,
"and how you came here."</p>

<p>Then Gerda told her everything, while the old
woman shook her head and said, "Hem-hem"; and
when Gerda had finished she asked the old woman
if she had not seen little Kay. She told her he
had not passed that way, but he very likely would
come. She told Gerda not to be sorrowful, but to
taste the cherries and look at the flowers; they
were better than any picture book, for each of
them could tell a story. Then she took Gerda
by the hand, and led her into the little house,
and closed the door. The windows were very
high, and as the panes were red, blue, and yellow,
the daylight shone through them in all sorts
of singular colors. On the table stood some beautiful
cherries, and Gerda had permission to eat as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
many as she would. While she was eating them
the old woman combed out her long flaxen ringlets
with a golden comb, and the glossy curls hung
down on each side of the little round, pleasant
face, which looked fresh and blooming as a rose.</p>

<p>"I have long been wishing for a dear little
maiden like you," said the old woman, "and now
you must stay with me and see how happily we
shall live together." And while she went on
combing little Gerda's hair the child thought less
and less about her adopted brother Kay, for the
old woman was an enchantress, although she was
not a wicked witch; she conjured only a little
for her own amusement, and, now, because she
wanted to keep Gerda. Therefore she went into
the garden and stretched out her crutch toward
all the rose trees, beautiful though they were, and
they immediately sank into the dark earth, so
that no one could tell where they had once stood.
The old woman was afraid that if little Gerda
saw roses, she would think of those at home and
then remember little Kay and run away.</p>

<p>Then she took Gerda into the flower garden.
How fragrant and beautiful it was! Every flower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
that could be thought of, for every season of the
year, was here in full bloom; no picture book could
have more beautiful colors. Gerda jumped for
joy, and played till the sun went down behind
the tall cherry trees; then she slept in an elegant
bed, with red silk pillows embroidered with colored
violets, and she dreamed as pleasantly as
a queen on her wedding day.</p>

<p>The next day, and for many days after, Gerda
played with the flowers in the warm sunshine.
She knew every flower, and yet, although there
were so many of them, it seemed as if one were
missing, but what it was she could not tell. One
day, however, as she sat looking at the old woman's
hat with the painted flowers on it, she saw that
the prettiest of them all was a rose. The old
woman had forgotten to take it from her hat
when she made all the roses sink into the earth.
But it is difficult to keep the thoughts together
in everything, and one little mistake upsets all
our arrangements.</p>

<p>"What! are there no roses here?" cried Gerda,
and she ran out into the garden and examined all
the beds, and searched and searched. There was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
not one to be found. Then she sat down and
wept, and her tears fell just on the place where
one of the rose trees had sunk down. The warm
tears moistened the earth, and the rose tree
sprouted up at once, as blooming as when it had
sunk; and Gerda embraced it, and kissed the
roses, and thought of the beautiful roses at home,
and, with them, of little Kay.</p>

<p>"Oh, how I have been detained!" said the
little maiden. "I wanted to seek for little Kay.
Do you know where he is?" she asked the roses;
"do you think he is dead?"</p>

<p>And the roses answered: "No, he is not dead.
We have been in the ground, where all the dead
lie, but Kay is not there."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said little Gerda, and then she
went to the other flowers and looked into their
little cups and asked, "Do you know where
little Kay is?" But each flower as it stood in
the sunshine dreamed only of its own little
fairy tale or history. Not one knew anything
of Kay. Gerda heard many stories from the
flowers, as she asked them one after another
about him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>And then she ran to the other end of the garden.
The door was fastened, but she pressed
against the rusty latch, and it gave way. The
door sprang open, and little Gerda ran out with
bare feet into the wide world. She looked back
three times, but no one seemed to be following
her. At last she could run no longer, so she sat
down to rest on a great stone, and when she
looked around she saw that the summer was
over and autumn very far advanced. She had
known nothing of this in the beautiful garden
where the sun shone and the flowers grew all
the year round.</p>

<p>"Oh, how I have wasted my time!" said little
Gerda. "It is autumn; I must not rest any
longer," and she rose to go on. But her little
feet were wounded and sore, and everything
around her looked cold and bleak. The long
willow leaves were quite yellow, the dewdrops
fell like water, leaf after leaf dropped from
the trees; the sloe thorn alone still bore fruit,
but the sloes were sour and set the teeth on
edge. Oh, how dark and weary the whole world
appeared!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>


<h3>FOURTH STORY</h3>

<div class='center'>THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS</div>

<p>Gerda was obliged to rest again, and just opposite
the place where she sat she saw a great crow
come hopping toward her across the snow. He
stood looking at her for some time, and then he
wagged his head and said, "Caw, caw, good day,
good day." He pronounced the words as plainly
as he could, because he meant to be kind to the
little girl, and then he asked her where she was
going all alone in the wide world.</p>

<p>The word "alone" Gerda understood very well
and felt how much it expressed. So she told the
crow the whole story of her life and adventures
and asked him if he had seen little Kay.</p>

<p>The crow nodded his head very gravely and
said, "Perhaps I have&mdash;it may be."</p>

<p>"No! Do you really think you have?" cried
little Gerda, and she kissed the crow and hugged
him almost to death, with joy.</p>

<p>"Gently, gently," said the crow. "I believe I
know. I think it may be little Kay; but he has certainly
forgotten you by this time, for the princess."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Does he live with a princess?" asked Gerda.</p>

<p>"Yes, listen," replied the crow; "but it is so
difficult to speak your language. If you understand
the crows' language, then I can explain it
better. Do you?"</p>

<p>"No, I have never learned it," said Gerda, "but
my grandmother understands it, and used to speak
it to me. I wish I had learned it."</p>

<p>"It does not matter," answered the crow. "I will
explain as well as I can, although it will be very
badly done"; and he told her what he had heard.</p>

<p>"In this kingdom where we now are," said he,
"there lives a princess who is so wonderfully
clever that she has read all the newspapers in
the world&mdash;and forgotten them too, although
she is so clever.</p>

<p>"A short time ago, as she was sitting on her
throne, which people say is not such an agreeable
seat as is often supposed, she began to sing a
song which commences with these words:</p>

<div class='center'>
Why should I not be married?<br />
</div>

<p>'Why not, indeed?' said she, and so she determined
to marry if she could find a husband who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
knew what to say when he was spoken to, and
not one who could only look grand, for that was
so tiresome. She assembled all her court ladies
at the beat of the drum, and when they heard of
her intentions they were very much pleased.</p>

<p>"'We are so glad to hear of it,' said they.
'We were talking about it ourselves the other
day.'</p>

<p>"You may believe that every word I tell you is
true," said the crow, "for I have a tame sweetheart
who hops freely about the palace, and she
told me all this."</p>

<p>Of course his sweetheart was a crow, for "birds
of a feather flock together," and one crow always
chooses another crow.</p>

<p>"Newspapers were published immediately with
a border of hearts and the initials of the princess
among them. They gave notice that every young
man who was handsome was free to visit the
castle and speak with the princess, and those
who could reply loud enough to be heard when
spoken to were to make themselves quite at
home at the palace, and the one who spoke best
would be chosen as a husband for the princess.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, yes, you may believe me. It is all as true
as I sit here," said the crow.</p>

<p>"The people came in crowds. There was a
great deal of crushing and running about, but no
one succeeded either on the first or the second
day. They could all speak very well while they
were outside in the streets, but when they entered
the palace gates and saw the guards in silver uniforms
and the footmen in their golden livery on
the staircase and the great halls lighted up, they
became quite confused. And when they stood
before the throne on which the princess sat they
could do nothing but repeat the last words she
had said, and she had no particular wish to hear
her own words over again. It was just as if they
had all taken something to make them sleepy while
they were in the palace, for they did not recover
themselves nor speak till they got back again into
the street. There was a long procession of them,
reaching from the town gate to the palace.</p>

<p>"I went myself to see them," said the crow.
"They were hungry and thirsty, for at the palace
they did not even get a glass of water. Some
of the wisest had taken a few slices of bread and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
butter with them, but they did not share it with
their neighbors; they thought if the others went
in to the princess looking hungry, there would be
a better chance for themselves."</p>

<p>"But Kay! tell me about little Kay!" said
Gerda. "Was he among the crowd?"</p>

<p>"Stop a bit; we are just coming to him. It
was on the third day that there came marching
cheerfully along to the palace a little personage
without horses or carriage, his eyes sparkling like
yours. He had beautiful long hair, but his clothes
were very poor."</p>

<p>"That was Kay," said Gerda, joyfully. "Oh, then
I have found him!" and she clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"He had a little knapsack on his back," added
the crow.</p>

<p>"No, it must have been his sledge," said Gerda,
"for he went away with it."</p>

<p>"It may have been so," said the crow; "I did
not look at it very closely. But I know from my
tame sweetheart that he passed through the palace
gates, saw the guards in their silver uniform
and the servants in their liveries of gold on the
stairs, but was not in the least embarrassed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"'It must be very tiresome to stand on the
stairs,' he said. 'I prefer to go in.'</p>

<p>"The rooms were blazing with light; councilors
and ambassadors walked about with bare
feet, carrying golden vessels; it was enough to
make any one feel serious. His boots creaked
loudly as he walked, and yet he was not at all
uneasy."</p>

<p>"It must be Kay," said Gerda; "I know he
had new boots on. I heard them creak in grandmother's
room."</p>

<p>"They really did creak," said the crow, "yet
he went boldly up to the princess herself, who was
sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning wheel.
And all the ladies of the court were present with
their maids and all the cavaliers with their servants,
and each of the maids had another maid
to wait upon her, and the cavaliers' servants had
their own servants as well as each a page. They
all stood in circles round the princess, and the
nearer they stood to the door the prouder they
looked. The servants' pages, who always wore
slippers, could hardly be looked at, they held
themselves up so proudly by the door."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"It must be quite awful," said little Gerda;
"but did Kay win the princess?"</p>

<p>"If I had not been a crow," said he, "I would
have married her myself, although I am engaged.
He spoke as well as I do when I speak the crows'
language. I heard this from my tame sweetheart.
He was quite free and agreeable and said he had
not come to woo the princess, but to hear her
wisdom. And he was as pleased with her as she
was with him."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly that was Kay," said Gerda; "he
was so clever; he could work mental arithmetic and
fractions. Oh, will you take me to the palace?"</p>

<p>"It is very easy to ask that," replied the crow,
"but how are we to manage it? However, I will
speak about it to my tame sweetheart and ask
her advice, for, I must tell you, it will be very
difficult to gain permission for a little girl like
you to enter the palace."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, but I shall gain permission easily,"
said Gerda, "for when Kay hears that I am here
he will come out and fetch me in immediately."</p>

<p>"Wait for me here by the palings," said the
crow, wagging his head as he flew away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>It was late in the evening before the crow returned.
"Caw, caw!" he said; "she sends you greeting,
and here is a little roll which she took from the
kitchen for you. There is plenty of bread there,
and she thinks you must be hungry. It is not possible
for you to enter the palace by the front entrance.
The guards in silver uniform and the servants in
gold livery would not allow it. But do not cry; we
will manage to get you in. My sweetheart knows
a little back staircase that leads to the sleeping
apartments, and she knows where to find the key."</p>

<p>Then they went into the garden, through the
great avenue, where the leaves were falling one
after another, and they could see the lights in
the palace being put out in the same manner.
And the crow led little Gerda to a back door
which stood ajar. Oh! how her heart beat with
anxiety and longing; it was as if she were going
to do something wrong, and yet she only wanted
to know where little Kay was.</p>

<p>"It must be he," she thought, "with those clear
eyes and that long hair."</p>

<p>She could fancy she saw him smiling at her
as he used to at home when they sat among the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
roses. He would certainly be glad to see her,
and to hear what a long distance she had come
for his sake, and to know how sorry they had all
been at home because he did not come back. Oh,
what joy and yet what fear she felt!</p>

<p>They were now on the stairs, and in a small
closet at the top a lamp was burning. In the
middle of the floor stood the tame crow, turning
her head from side to side and gazing at Gerda, who
curtsied as her grandmother had taught her to do.</p>

<p>"My betrothed has spoken so very highly of
you, my little lady," said the tame crow. "Your
story is very touching. If you will take the lamp,
I will walk before you. We will go straight along
this way; then we shall meet no one."</p>

<p>"I feel as if somebody were behind us," said
Gerda, as something rushed by her like a shadow
on the wall; and then it seemed to her that
horses with flying manes and thin legs, hunters,
ladies and gentlemen on horseback, glided by
her like shadows.</p>

<p>"They are only dreams," said the crow; "they
are coming to carry the thoughts of the great
people out hunting. All the better, for if their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
thoughts are out hunting, we shall be able to
look at them in their beds more safely. I hope
that when you rise to honor and favor you will
show a grateful heart."</p>

<p>"You may be quite sure of that," said the crow
from the forest.</p>

<p>They now came into the first hall, the walls
of which were hung with rose-colored satin embroidered
with artificial flowers. Here the dreams
again flitted by them, but so quickly that Gerda
could not distinguish the royal persons. Each
hall appeared more splendid than the last. It
was enough to bewilder one. At length they
reached a bedroom. The ceiling was like a great
palm tree, with glass leaves of the most costly
crystal, and over the center of the floor two beds,
each resembling a lily, hung from a stem of gold.
One, in which the princess lay, was white; the
other was red. And in this Gerda had to seek
for little Kay.</p>

<p>She pushed one of the red leaves aside and
saw a little brown neck. Oh, that must be Kay!
She called his name loudly and held the lamp
over him. The dreams rushed back into the room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
on horseback. He woke and turned his head
round&mdash;it was not little Kay! The prince was
only like him; still he was young and pretty.
Out of her white-lily bed peeped the princess,
and asked what was the matter. Little Gerda
wept and told her story, and all that the crows
had done to help her.</p>

<p>"You poor child," said the prince and princess;
then they praised the crows, and said they
were not angry with them for what they had
done, but that it must not happen again, and
that this time they should be rewarded.</p>

<p>"Would you like to have your freedom?"
asked the princess, "or would you prefer to be
raised to the position of court crows, with all
that is left in the kitchen for yourselves?"</p>

<p>Then both the crows bowed and begged to have
a fixed appointment; for they thought of their old
age, and it would be so comfortable, they said,
to feel that they had made provision for it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 335px;">
<img src="images/p227i.png" width="335" height="500" alt="The prince and princess themselves helped her into the coach." title="" />
</div>

<p>And then the prince got out of his bed and
gave it up to Gerda&mdash;he could not do more&mdash;and
she lay down. She folded her little hands
and thought, "How good everybody is to me,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
both men and animals"; then she closed her eyes
and fell into a sweet sleep. All the dreams came
flying back again to her, looking like angels now,
and one of them drew a little sledge, on which
sat Kay, who nodded to her. But all this was only
a dream. It vanished as soon as she awoke.</p>

<p>The following day she was dressed from head
to foot in silk and velvet and invited to stay at
the palace for a few days and enjoy herself; but
she only begged for a pair of boots and a little
carriage and a horse to draw it, so that she might
go out into the wide world to seek for Kay.</p>

<p>And she obtained not only boots but a muff,
and was neatly dressed; and when she was ready
to go, there at the door she found a coach made
of pure gold with the coat of arms of the prince
and princess shining upon it like a star, and the
coachman, footman, and outriders all wearing
golden crowns upon their heads. The prince and
princess themselves helped her into the coach
and wished her success.</p>

<p>The forest crow, who was now married, accompanied
her for the first three miles; he sat
by Gerda's side, as he could not bear riding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
backwards. The tame crow stood in the doorway
flapping her wings. She could not go with them,
because she had been suffering from headache
ever since the new appointment, no doubt from
overeating. The coach was well stored with sweet
cakes, and under the seat were fruit and gingerbread
nuts.</p>

<p>"Farewell, farewell," cried the prince and princess,
and little Gerda wept, and the crow wept;
and then, after a few miles, the crow also said
farewell, and this parting was even more sad.
However he flew to a tree and stood flapping his
black wings as long as he could see the coach,
which glittered like a sunbeam.</p>


<h3>FIFTH STORY</h3>

<div class='center'>THE LITTLE ROBBER GIRL</div>

<p>The coach drove on through a thick forest,
where it lighted up the way like a torch and
dazzled the eyes of some robbers, who could not
bear to let it pass them unmolested.</p>

<p>"It is gold! it is gold!" cried they, rushing
forward and seizing the horses. Then they struck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
dead the little jockeys, the coachman, and the
footman, and pulled little Gerda out of the
carriage.</p>

<p>"She is plump and pretty. She has been fed
with the kernels of nuts," said the old robber
woman, who had a long beard, and eyebrows that
hung over her eyes. "She is as good as a fatted
lamb; how nice she will taste!" and as she said
this she drew forth a shining knife, that glittered
horribly. "Oh!" screamed the old woman at the
same moment, for her own daughter, who held
her back, had bitten her in the ear. "You naughty
girl," said the mother, and now she had not time
to kill Gerda.</p>

<p>"She shall play with me," said the little robber
girl. "She shall give me her muff and her pretty
dress, and sleep with me in my bed." And then
she bit her mother again, and all the robbers
laughed.</p>

<p>"I will have a ride in the coach," said the little
robber girl, and she would have her own way, for
she was self-willed and obstinate.</p>

<p>She and Gerda seated themselves in the coach
and drove away over stumps and stones, into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
depths of the forest. The little robber girl was
about the same size as Gerda, but stronger; she
had broader shoulders and a darker skin; her
eyes were quite black, and she had a mournful
look. She clasped little Gerda round the waist
and said:</p>

<p>"They shall not kill you as long as you don't
make me vexed with you. I suppose you are a
princess."</p>

<p>"No," said Gerda; and then she told her all
her history and how fond she was of little Kay.</p>

<p>The robber girl looked earnestly at her, nodded
her head slightly, and said, "They shan't kill
you even if I do get angry with you, for I will
do it myself." And then she wiped Gerda's eyes
and put her own hands into the beautiful muff,
which was so soft and warm.</p>

<p>The coach stopped in the courtyard of a robber's
castle, the walls of which were full of cracks
from top to bottom. Ravens and crows flew in
and out of the holes and crevices, while great bulldogs,
each of which looked as if it could swallow
a man, were jumping about; but they were not
allowed to bark.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>In the large old smoky hall a bright fire was
burning on the stone floor. There was no chimney,
so the smoke went up to the ceiling and
found a way out for itself. Soup was boiling in
a large cauldron, and hares and rabbits were
roasting on the spit.</p>

<p>"You shall sleep with me and all my little
animals to-night," said the robber girl after they
had had something to eat and drink. So she took
Gerda to a corner of the hall where some straw
and carpets were laid down. Above them, on
laths and perches, were more than a hundred
pigeons that all seemed to be asleep, although
they moved slightly when the two little girls
came near them. "These all belong to me," said
the robber girl, and she seized the nearest to her,
held it by the feet, and shook it till it flapped its
wings. "Kiss it," cried she, flapping it in Gerda's
face.</p>

<p>"There sit the wood pigeons," continued she,
pointing to a number of laths and a cage which
had been fixed into the walls, near one of the
openings. "Both rascals would fly away directly,
if they were not closely locked up. And here is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
my old sweetheart 'Ba,'" and she dragged out a
reindeer by the horn; he wore a bright copper
ring round his neck and was tethered to the spot.
"We are obliged to hold him tight too, else he
would run away from us also. I tickle his neck
every evening with my sharp knife, which frightens
him very much." And the robber girl drew a long
knife from a chink in the wall and let it slide
gently over the reindeer's neck. The poor animal
began to kick, and the little robber girl laughed
and pulled down Gerda into bed with her.</p>

<p>"Will you have that knife with you while you
are asleep?" asked Gerda, looking at it in great
fright.</p>

<p>"I always sleep with the knife by me," said the
robber girl. "No one knows what may happen.
But now tell me again all about little Kay, and
why you went out into the world."</p>

<p>Then Gerda repeated her story over again, while
the wood pigeons in the cage over her cooed, and
the other pigeons slept. The little robber girl
put one arm across Gerda's neck, and held the
knife in the other, and was soon fast asleep and
snoring. But Gerda could not close her eyes at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
all; she knew not whether she was to live or to die.
The robbers sat round the fire, singing and drinking.
It was a terrible sight for a little girl to witness.</p>

<p>Then the wood pigeons said: "Coo, coo, we have
seen little Kay. A white fowl carried his sledge,
and he sat in the carriage of the Snow Queen,
which drove through the wood while we were
lying in our nest. She blew upon us, and all the
young ones died, excepting us two. Coo, coo."</p>

<p>"What are you saying up there?" cried Gerda.
"Where was the Snow Queen going? Do you
know anything about it?"</p>

<p>"She was most likely traveling to Lapland,
where there is always snow and ice. Ask the
reindeer that is fastened up there with a rope."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is always snow and ice," said the
reindeer, "and it is a glorious place; you can leap
and run about freely on the sparkling icy plains.
The Snow Queen has her summer tent there, but
her strong castle is at the North Pole, on an
island called Spitzbergen."</p>

<p>"O Kay, little Kay!" sighed Gerda.</p>

<p>"Lie still," said the robber girl, "or you shall
feel my knife."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning Gerda told her all that the
wood pigeons had said, and the little robber girl
looked quite serious, and nodded her head and
said: "That is all talk, that is all talk. Do you
know where Lapland is?" she asked the reindeer.</p>

<p>"Who should know better than I do?" said
the animal, while his eyes sparkled. "I was born
and brought up there and used to run about
the snow-covered plains."</p>

<p>"Now listen," said the robber girl; "all our men
are gone away; only mother is here, and here she
will stay; but at noon she always drinks out of a
great bottle, and afterwards sleeps for a little while;
and then I'll do something for you." She jumped
out of bed, clasped her mother round the neck,
and pulled her by the beard, crying, "My own
little nanny goat, good morning!" And her mother
pinched her nose till it was quite red; yet she did
it all for love.</p>

<p>When the mother had gone to sleep the little
robber maiden went to the reindeer and said: "I
should like very much to tickle your neck a few
times more with my knife, for it makes you look
so funny, but never mind&mdash;I will untie your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
cord and set you free, so that you may run away
to Lapland; but you must make good use of your
legs and carry this little maiden to the castle of
the Snow Queen, where her playfellow is. You
have heard what she told me, for she spoke loud
enough, and you were listening."</p>

<p>The reindeer jumped for joy, and the little
robber girl lifted Gerda on his back and had the
forethought to tie her on and even to give her
her own little cushion to sit upon.</p>

<p>"Here are your fur boots for you," said she,
"for it will be very cold; but I must keep the
muff, it is so pretty. However, you shall not be
frozen for the want of it; here are my mother's
large warm mittens; they will reach up to your
elbows. Let me put them on. There, now your
hands look just like my mother's."</p>

<p>But Gerda wept for joy.</p>

<p>"I don't like to see you fret," said the little
robber girl. "You ought to look quite happy
now. And here are two loaves and a ham, so
that you need not starve."</p>

<p>These were fastened upon the reindeer, and
then the little robber maiden opened the door,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
coaxed in all the great dogs, cut the string with
which the reindeer was fastened, with her sharp
knife, and said, "Now run, but mind you take
good care of the little girl." And Gerda stretched
out her hand, with the great mitten on it, toward
the little robber girl and said "Farewell," and
away flew the reindeer over stumps and stones,
through the great forest, over marshes and plains,
as quickly as he could. The wolves howled and
the ravens screamed, while up in the sky quivered
red lights like flames of fire. "There are my old
northern lights," said the reindeer; "see how they
flash!" And he ran on day and night still faster
and faster, but the loaves and the ham were all
eaten by the time they reached Lapland.</p>


<h3>SIXTH STORY</h3>

<div class='center'>THE LAPLAND WOMAN AND THE FINLAND
WOMAN</div>

<p>They stopped at a little hut; it was very mean
looking. The roof sloped nearly down to the
ground, and the door was so low that the family
had to creep in on their hands and knees when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
they went in and out. There was no one at home
but an old Lapland woman who was dressing fish
by the light of a train-oil lamp.</p>

<p>The reindeer told her all about Gerda's story
after having first told his own, which seemed to him
the most important. But Gerda was so pinched
with the cold that she could not speak.</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor things," said the Lapland woman,
"you have a long way to go yet. You must travel
more than a hundred miles farther, to Finland.
The Snow Queen lives there now, and she burns
Bengal lights every evening. I will write a few
words on a dried stockfish, for I have no paper,
and you can take it from me to the Finland
woman who lives there. She can give you better
information than I can."</p>

<p>So when Gerda was warmed and had taken
something to eat and drink, the woman wrote a
few words on the dried fish and told Gerda to take
great care of it. Then she tied her again on the
back of the reindeer, and he sprang high into
the air and set off at full speed. Flash, flash,
went the beautiful blue northern lights the whole
night long.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>And at length they reached Finland and
knocked at the chimney of the Finland woman's
hut, for it had no door above the ground. They
crept in, but it was so terribly hot inside that the
woman wore scarcely any clothes. She was small
and very dirty looking. She loosened little Gerda's
dress and took off the fur boots and the mittens,
or Gerda would have been unable to bear the heat;
and then she placed a piece of ice on the reindeer's
head and read what was written on the
dried fish. After she had read it three times she
knew it by heart, so she popped the fish into the
soup saucepan, as she knew it was good to eat,
and she never wasted anything.</p>

<p>The reindeer told his own story first and then
little Gerda's, and the Finlander twinkled with
her clever eyes, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"You are so clever," said the reindeer; "I know
you can tie all the winds of the world with a piece
of twine. If a sailor unties one knot, he has a fair
wind; when he unties the second, it blows hard;
but if the third and fourth are loosened, then
comes a storm which will root up whole forests.
Cannot you give this little maiden something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
which will make her as strong as twelve men, to
overcome the Snow Queen?"</p>

<p>"The power of twelve men!" said the Finland
woman. "That would be of very little use." But
she went to a shelf and took down and unrolled
a large skin on which were inscribed wonderful
characters, and she read till the perspiration ran
down from her forehead.</p>

<p>But the reindeer begged so hard for little Gerda,
and Gerda looked at the Finland woman with such
tender, tearful eyes, that her own eyes began to
twinkle again. She drew the reindeer into a corner
and whispered to him while she laid a fresh piece
of ice on his head: "Little Kay is really with the
Snow Queen, but he finds everything there so
much to his taste and his liking that he believes
it is the finest place in the world; and this is because
he has a piece of broken glass in his heart
and a little splinter of glass in his eye. These
must be taken out, or he will never be a human
being again, and the Snow Queen will retain her
power over him."</p>

<p>"But can you not give little Gerda something
to help her to conquer this power?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can give her no greater power than she has
already," said the woman; "don't you see how
strong that is? how men and animals are obliged
to serve her, and how well she has gotten through
the world, barefooted as she is? She cannot receive
any power from me greater than she now has,
which consists in her own purity and innocence
of heart. If she cannot herself obtain access to
the Snow Queen and remove the glass fragments
from little Kay, we can do nothing to help her.
Two miles from here the Snow Queen's garden
begins. You can carry the little girl so far, and
set her down by the large bush which stands in
the snow, covered with red berries. Do not stay
gossiping, but come back here as quickly as you
can." Then the Finland woman lifted little Gerda
upon the reindeer, and he ran away with her as
quickly as he could.</p>

<p>"Oh, I have forgotten my boots and my mittens,"
cried little Gerda, as soon as she felt the
cutting cold; but the reindeer dared not stop, so
he ran on till he reached the bush with the red
berries. Here he set Gerda down, and he kissed
her, and the great bright tears trickled over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
animal's cheeks; then he left her and ran back
as fast as he could.</p>

<p>There stood poor Gerda, without shoes, without
gloves, in the midst of cold, dreary, ice-bound
Finland. She ran forward as quickly as she
could, when a whole regiment of snowflakes came
round her. They did not, however, fall from the
sky, which was quite clear and glittered with
the northern lights. The snowflakes ran along
the ground, and the nearer they came to her the
larger they appeared. Gerda remembered how
large and beautiful they looked through the burning
glass. But these were really larger and much
more terrible, for they were alive and were the
guards of the Snow Queen and had the strangest
shapes. Some were like great porcupines, others
like twisted serpents with their heads stretching
out, and some few were like little fat bears with
their hair bristled; but all were dazzlingly white,
and all were living snowflakes.</p>

<p>Little Gerda repeated the Lord's Prayer, and
the cold was so great that she could see her
own breath come out of her mouth like steam,
as she uttered the words. The steam appeared to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
increase as she continued her prayer, till it took
the shape of little angels, who grew larger the
moment they touched the earth. They all wore
helmets on their heads and carried spears and
shields. Their number continued to increase more
and more, and by the time Gerda had finished
her prayers a whole legion stood round her. They
thrust their spears into the terrible snowflakes
so that they shivered into a hundred pieces, and
little Gerda could go forward with courage and
safety. The angels stroked her hands and feet,
so that she felt the cold less as she hastened on
to the Snow Queen's castle.</p>

<p>But now we must see what Kay is doing. In
truth he thought not of little Gerda, and least
of all that she could be standing at the front of
the palace.</p>


<h3>SEVENTH STORY</h3>

<div class='center'>OF THE PALACE OF THE SNOW QUEEN AND<br />
WHAT HAPPENED THERE AT LAST</div>

<p>The walls of the palace were formed of drifted
snow, and the windows and doors of cutting
winds. There were more than a hundred rooms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
in it, all as if they had been formed of snow
blown together. The largest of them extended
for several miles. They were all lighted up by
the vivid light of the aurora, and were so large
and empty, so icy cold and glittering!</p>

<p>There were no amusements here; not even a
little bear's ball, when the storm might have been
the music, and the bears could have danced on
their hind legs and shown their good manners.
There were no pleasant games of snapdragon, or
touch, nor even a gossip over the tea table for
the young-lady foxes. Empty, vast, and cold were
the halls of the Snow Queen.</p>

<p>The flickering flames of the northern lights
could be plainly seen, whether they rose high or
low in the heavens, from every part of the castle.
In the midst of this empty, endless hall of snow
was a frozen lake, broken on its surface into a
thousand forms; each piece resembled another,
because each was in itself perfect as a work of
art, and in the center of this lake sat the Snow
Queen when she was at home. She called the
lake "The Mirror of Reason," and said that it was
the best, and indeed the only one, in the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/p245i.png" width="339" height="500" alt="In the center of the lake sat the Snow Queen" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Kay was quite blue with cold,&mdash;indeed,
almost black,&mdash;but he did not feel it; for the Snow
Queen had kissed away the icy shiverings, and
his heart was already a lump of ice. He dragged
some sharp, flat pieces of ice to and fro and
placed them together in all kinds of positions, as
if he wished to make something out of them&mdash;just
as we try to form various figures with little tablets
of wood, which we call a "Chinese puzzle." Kay's
figures were very artistic; it was the icy game of
reason at which he played, and in his eyes the
figures were very remarkable and of the highest
importance; this opinion was owing to the splinter
of glass still sticking in his eye. He composed
many complete figures, forming different
words, but there was one word he never could
manage to form, although he wished it very
much. It was the word "Eternity."</p>

<p>The Snow Queen had said to him, "When you
can find out this, you shall be your own master,
and I will give you the whole world and a new
pair of skates." But he could not accomplish it.</p>

<p>"Now I must hasten away to warmer countries,"
said the Snow Queen. "I will go and look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
into the black craters of the tops of the burning
mountains, Etna and Vesuvius, as they are called.
I shall make them look white, which will be good
for them and for the lemons and the grapes."
And away flew the Snow Queen, leaving little
Kay quite alone in the great hall which was so
many miles in length. He sat and looked at his
pieces of ice and was thinking so deeply and sat
so still that any one might have supposed he
was frozen.</p>

<p>Just at this moment it happened that little
Gerda came through the great door of the castle.
Cutting winds were raging around her, but she
offered up a prayer, and the winds sank down
as if they were going to sleep. On she went till
she came to the large, empty hall and caught
sight of Kay. She knew him directly; she flew
to him and threw her arms around his neck and
held him fast while she exclaimed, "Kay, dear
little Kay, I have found you at last!"</p>

<p>But he sat quite still, stiff and cold.</p>

<p>Then little Gerda wept hot tears, which fell
on his breast, and penetrated into his heart, and
thawed the lump of ice, and washed away the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
piece of glass which had stuck there. Then he
looked at her, and she sang:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Roses bloom and fade away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But we the Christ-child see alway."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Then Kay burst into tears. He wept so that
the splinter of glass swam out of his eye. Then
he recognized Gerda and said joyfully, "Gerda,
dear little Gerda, where have you been all this
time, and where have I been?" And he looked
all around him and said, "How cold it is, and
how large and empty it all looks," and he clung
to Gerda, and she laughed and wept for joy.</p>

<p>It was so pleasing to see them that even the
pieces of ice danced, and when they were tired
and went to lie down they formed themselves
into the letters of the word which the Snow Queen
had said he must find out before he could be his
own master and have the whole world and a pair
of new skates.</p>

<p>Gerda kissed his cheeks, and they became
blooming; and she kissed his eyes till they shone
like her own; she kissed his hands and feet, and
he became quite healthy and cheerful. The Snow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Queen might come home now when she pleased,
for there stood his certainty of freedom, in the
word she wanted, written in shining letters of ice.</p>

<p>Then they took each other by the hand and
went forth from the great palace of ice. They
spoke of the grandmother and of the roses on the
roof, and as they went on the winds were at rest,
and the sun burst forth. When they arrived at
the bush with red berries, there stood the reindeer
waiting for them, and he had brought another
young reindeer with him, whose udders were full,
and the children drank her warm milk and kissed
her on the mouth.</p>

<p>They carried Kay and Gerda first to the Finland
woman, where they warmed themselves thoroughly
in the hot room and had directions about
their journey home. Next they went to the Lapland
woman, who had made some new clothes for
them and put their sleighs in order. Both the
reindeer ran by their side and followed them as
far as the boundaries of the country, where the
first green leaves were budding. And here they
took leave of the two reindeer and the Lapland
woman, and all said farewell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Then birds began to twitter, and the forest
too was full of green young leaves, and out of
it came a beautiful horse, which Gerda remembered,
for it was one which had drawn the golden
coach. A young girl was riding upon it, with a
shining red cap on her head and pistols in her
belt. It was the little robber maiden, who had
got tired of staying at home; she was going first
to the north, and if that did not suit her, she
meant to try some other part of the world. She
knew Gerda directly, and Gerda remembered her;
it was a joyful meeting.</p>

<p>"You are a fine fellow to go gadding about in
this way," said she to little Kay. "I should like
to know whether you deserve that any one should
go to the end of the world to find you."</p>

<p>But Gerda patted her cheeks and asked after
the prince and princess.</p>

<p>"They are gone to foreign countries," said the
robber girl.</p>

<p>"And the crow?" asked Gerda.</p>

<p>"Oh, the crow is dead," she replied. "His tame
sweetheart is now a widow and wears a bit of
black worsted round her leg. She mourns very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
pitifully, but it is all stuff. But now tell me how
you managed to get him back."</p>

<p>Then Gerda and Kay told her all about it.</p>

<p>"Snip, snap, snurre! it's all right at last," said
the robber girl.</p>

<p>She took both their hands and promised that
if ever she should pass through the town, she
would call and pay them a visit. And then she
rode away into the wide world.</p>

<p>But Gerda and Kay went hand in hand toward
home, and as they advanced, spring appeared
more lovely with its green verdure and its beautiful
flowers. Very soon they recognized the large
town where they lived, and the tall steeples of the
churches in which the sweet bells were ringing a
merry peal, as they entered it and found their way
to their grandmother's door.</p>

<p>They went upstairs into the little room, where
all looked just as it used to do. The old clock was
going "Tick, tick," and the hands pointed to the
time of day, but as they passed through the door
into the room they perceived that they were both
grown up and become a man and woman. The
roses out on the roof were in full bloom and peeped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
in at the window, and there stood the little chairs
on which they had sat when children, and Kay
and Gerda seated themselves each on their own
chair and held each other by the hand, while the
cold, empty grandeur of the Snow Queen's palace
vanished from their memories like a painful dream.</p>

<p>The grandmother sat in God's bright sunshine,
and she read aloud from the Bible, "Except ye
become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter
into the kingdom of God." And Kay and Gerda
looked into each other's eyes and all at once
understood the words of the old song:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Roses bloom and fade away,<br />
But we the Christ-child see alway.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>And they both sat there, grown up, yet children

<p>A few minutes before, all the ducks had been
resting on the water or standing on their heads&mdash;for
that they can do&mdash;and then they all swam in a
bustle to the shore. The traces of their feet could
be seen on the wet earth, and far and wide could
be heard their quacking. The water, so lately clear
and bright as a mirror, was in quite a commotion.</p>

<p>But a moment before, every tree and bush near
the old farmhouse&mdash;and even the house itself with
the holes in the roof and the swallows' nests and,

resembled a picture only that everything appeared
upside down, but when the water was set in
motion all vanished, and the picture disappeared.</p>

<p>Two feathers, dropped by the fluttering ducks,
floated to and fro on the water. All at once they
took a start as if the wind were coming, but it did
not come, so they were obliged to lie still, as the
water became again quiet and at rest. The roses
could once more behold their own reflections.
They were very beautiful, but they knew it not,
for no one had told them. The sun shone between
the delicate leaves, and the sweet fragrance spread
itself, carrying happiness everywhere.</p>

<p>"How beautiful is our existence!" said one of
the roses. "I feel as if I should like to kiss the
sun, it is so bright and warm. I should like to
kiss the roses too, our images in the water, and
the pretty birds there in their nests. There are
some birds too in the nest above us; they stretch
out their heads and cry 'Tweet, tweet,' very
faintly. They have no feathers yet, such as their
father and mother have. Both above us and below
us we have good neighbors. How beautiful
is our life!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>The young birds above and the young ones below
were the same; they were sparrows, and their
nest was reflected in the water. Their parents
were sparrows also, and they had taken possession
of an empty swallow's nest of the year before,
occupying it now as if it were their own.</p>

<p>"Are those ducks' children that are swimming
about? asked the young sparrows, as they spied
the feathers on the water.</p>

<p>"If you must ask questions, pray ask sensible
ones," said the mother. "Can you not see that
these are feathers, the living stuff for clothes, which
I wear and which you will wear soon, only ours
are much finer? I should like, however, to have
them up here in the nest, they would make it so
warm. I am rather curious to know why the ducks
were so alarmed just now. It could not be from
fear of us, certainly, though I did say 'tweet' rather
loudly. The thick-headed roses really ought to
know, but they are very ignorant; they only look
at one another and smell. I am heartily tired of
such neighbors."</p>

<p>"Listen to the sweet little birds above us," said
the roses; "they are trying to sing. They cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
manage it yet, but it will be done in time. What
a pleasure it will be, and how nice to have such
lively neighbors!"</p>

<p>Suddenly two horses came prancing along to
drink at the water. A peasant boy rode on one
of them; he had a broad-brimmed black hat on,
but had taken off the most of his clothes, that he
might ride into the deepest part of the pond; he
whistled like a bird, and while passing the rosebush
he plucked a rose and placed it in his hat
and then rode on thinking himself very fine. The
other roses looked at their sister and asked each
other where she could be going, but they did
not know.</p>

<p>"I should like for once to go out into the
world," said one, "although it is very lovely here
in our home of green leaves. The sun shines
warmly by day, and in the night we can see that
heaven is more beautiful still, as it sparkles
through the holes in the sky."</p>

<p>She meant the stars, for she knew no better.</p>

<p>"We make the house very lively," said the
mother sparrow, "and people say that a swallow's
nest brings luck, therefore they are pleased to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
us; but as to our neighbors, a rosebush on the wall
produces damp. It will most likely be removed,
and perhaps corn will grow here instead of it.
Roses are good for nothing but to be looked at
and smelt, or perhaps one may chance to be stuck
in a hat. I have heard from my mother that they
fall off every year. The farmer's wife preserves
them by laying them in salt, and then they receive
a French name which I neither can nor will
pronounce; then they are sprinkled on the fire to
produce a pleasant smell. Such you see is their
life. They are only formed to please the eye and
the nose. Now you know all about them."</p>

<p>As the evening approached, the gnats played
about in the warm air beneath the rosy clouds,
and the nightingale came and sang to the roses
that <i>the beautiful</i> was like sunshine to the world,
and that <i>the beautiful</i> lives forever. The roses
thought that the nightingale was singing of herself,
which any one indeed could easily suppose;
they never imagined that her song could refer to
them. But it was a joy to them, and they wondered
to themselves whether all the little sparrows in
the nest would become nightingales.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>"We understood that bird's song very well,"
said the young sparrows, "but one word was not
clear. What is <i>the beautiful?</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing of any consequence," replied the
mother sparrow. "It is something relating to appearances
over yonder at the nobleman's house.
The pigeons have a house of their own, and every
day they have corn and peas spread for them. I
have dined there with them sometimes, and so
shall you by and by, for I believe the old maxim&mdash;'Tell
me what company you keep, and I will
tell you what you are.' Well, over at the noble
house there are two birds with green throats and
crests on their heads. They can spread out their
tails like large wheels, and they reflect so many
beautiful colors that it dazzles the eyes to look
at them. These birds are called peacocks, and
they belong to <i>the beautiful;</i> but if only a few
of their feathers were plucked off, they would
not appear better than we do. I would myself
have plucked some out had they not been so
large."</p>

<p>"I will pluck them," squeaked the youngest
sparrow, who had as yet no feathers of his own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>In the cottage dwelt two young married people,
who loved each other very much and were
industrious and active so that everything looked
neat and pretty around them. Early on Sunday
mornings the young wife came out, gathered a
handful of the most beautiful roses, and put
them in a glass of water, which she placed on
a side table.</p>

<p>"I see now that it is Sunday," said the husband,
as he kissed his little wife. Then they sat
down and read in their hymn books, holding each
other's hands, while the sun shone down upon
the young couple and upon the fresh roses in
the glass.</p>

<p>"This sight is really too wearisome," said the
mother sparrow, who from her nest could look
into the room; and she flew away.</p>

<p>The same thing occurred the next Sunday; and
indeed every Sunday fresh roses were gathered
and placed in a glass, but the rose tree continued
to bloom in all its beauty. After a while the
young sparrows were fledged and wanted to fly,
but the mother would not allow it, and so they
were obliged to remain in the nest for the present,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
while she flew away alone. It so happened that
some boys had fastened a snare made of horsehair
to the branch of a tree, and before she was
aware, her leg became entangled in the horsehair
so tightly as almost to cut it through. What pain
and terror she felt! The boys ran up quickly and
seized her, not in a very gentle manner.</p>

<p>"It is only a sparrow," they said. However
they did not let her fly, but took her home with
them, and every time she cried they tapped her
on the beak.</p>

<p>In the farmyard they met an old man who
knew how to make soap for shaving and washing,
in cakes or in balls. When he saw the sparrow
which the boys had brought home and which they
said they did not know what to do with, he said,
"Shall we make it beautiful?"</p>

<p>A cold shudder passed over the sparrow when
she heard this. The old man then took a shell
containing a quantity of glittering gold leaf from
a box full of beautiful colors and told the youngsters
to fetch the white of an egg, with which he
besmeared the sparrow all over and then laid the
gold leaf upon it, so that the mother sparrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
was now gilded from head to tail. She thought
not of her appearance, but trembled in every limb.
Then the soap maker tore a little piece out of the
red lining of his jacket, cut notches in it, so that
it looked like a cock'scomb, and stuck it on the
bird's head.</p>

<p>"Now you shall see gold-jacket fly," said the
old man, and he released the sparrow, which flew
away in deadly terror with the sunlight shining
upon her. How she did glitter! All the sparrows,
and even a crow, who is a knowing old boy, were
startled at the sight, yet they all followed it to
discover what foreign bird it could be. Driven by
anguish and terror, she flew homeward almost
ready to sink to the earth for want of strength.
The flock of birds that were following increased
and some even tried to peck her.</p>

<p>"Look at him! look at him!" they all cried.
"Look at him! look at him!" cried the young
ones as their mother approached the nest, for they
did not know her. "That must be a young peacock,
for he glitters in all colors. It quite hurts
one's eyes to look at him, as mother told us;
'tweet,' this is <i>the beautiful</i>." And then they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
pecked the bird with their little beaks so that
she was quite unable to get into the nest and was
too much exhausted even to say "tweet," much
less "I am your mother." So the other birds fell
upon the sparrow and pulled out feather after
feather till she sank bleeding into the rosebush.</p>

<p>"You poor creature," said the roses, "be at rest.
We will hide you; lean your little head against us."</p>

<p>The sparrow spread out her wings once more,
then drew them in close about her and lay dead
among the roses, her fresh and lovely neighbors.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Tweet," sounded from the nest; "where can
our mother be staying? It is quite unaccountable.
Can this be a trick of hers to show us that we
are now to take care of ourselves? She has left
us the house as an inheritance, but as it cannot
belong to us all when we have families, who is
to have it?"</p>

<p>"It won't do for you all to stay with me when
I increase my household with a wife and children,"
remarked the youngest.</p>

<p>"I shall have more wives and children than
you," said the second.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I am the eldest," cried a third.</p>

<p>Then they all became angry, beat each other
with their wings, pecked with their beaks, till one
after another bounced out of the nest. There they
lay in a rage, holding their heads on one side and
twinkling the eye that looked upward. This was
their way of looking sulky.</p>

<p>They could all fly a little, and by practice they
soon learned to do so much better. At length
they agreed upon a sign by which they might
be able to recognize each other in case they
should meet in the world after they had separated.
This sign was to be the cry of "tweet, tweet,"
and a scratching on the ground three times with
the left foot.</p>

<p>The youngster who was left behind in the nest
spread himself out as broad as ever he could; he
was the householder now. But his glory did not
last long, for during that night red flames of fire
burst through the windows of the cottage, seized
the thatched roof, and blazed up frightfully. The
whole house was burned, and the sparrow perished
with it, while the young couple fortunately escaped
with their lives.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>When the sun rose again, and all nature looked
refreshed as after a quiet sleep, nothing remained
of the cottage but a few blackened, charred beams
leaning against the chimney, that now was the
only master of the place. Thick smoke still rose
from the ruins, but outside on the wall the rosebush
remained unhurt, blooming and fresh as ever,
while each flower and each spray was mirrored in
the clear water beneath.</p>

<p>"How beautifully the roses are blooming on
the walls of that ruined cottage," said a passer-by.
"A more lovely picture could scarcely be imagined.
I must have it."</p>

<p>And the speaker took out of his pocket a little
book full of white leaves of paper (for he was an
artist), and with a pencil he made a sketch of
the smoking ruins, the blackened rafters, and the
chimney that overhung them and which seemed
more and more to totter; and quite in the foreground
stood the large, blooming rosebush, which
added beauty to the picture; indeed, it was for
the sake of the roses that the sketch had been
made. Later in the day two of the sparrows who
had been born there came by.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is the house?" they asked. "Where
is the nest? Tweet, tweet; all is burned down,
and our strong brother with it. That is all he
got by keeping the nest. The roses have escaped
famously; they look as well as ever, with their
rosy cheeks; they do not trouble themselves
about their neighbors' misfortunes. I won't speak
to them. And really, in my opinion, the place
looks very ugly"; so they flew away.</p>

<p>On a fine, bright, sunny day in autumn, so
bright that any one might have supposed it was
still the middle of summer, a number of pigeons
were hopping about in the nicely kept courtyard
of the nobleman's house, in front of the great
steps. Some were black, others white, and some
of various colors, and their plumage glittered
in the sunshine. An old mother pigeon said to
her young ones, "Place yourselves in groups!
place yourselves in groups! it has a much better
appearance."</p>

<p>"What are those little gray creatures which
are running about behind us?" asked an old
pigeon with red and green round her eyes.
"Little gray ones, little gray ones," she cried.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are sparrows&mdash;good little creatures
enough. We have always had the character of
being very good-natured, so we allow them to
pick up some corn with us; they do not interrupt
our conversation, and they draw back their left
foot so prettily."</p>

<p>Sure enough, so they did, three times each,
and with the left foot too, and said "tweet," by
which we recognize them as the sparrows that
were brought up in the nest on the house that
was burned down.</p>

<p>"The food here is very good," said the sparrows;
while the pigeons strutted round each
other, puffed out their throats, and formed their
own opinions on what they observed.</p>

<p>"Do you see the pouter pigeon?" asked one
pigeon of another. "Do you see how he swallows
the peas? He takes too much and always
chooses the best of everything. Coo-oo, coo-oo.
How the ugly, spiteful creature erects his crest."
And all their eyes sparkled with malice. "Place
yourselves in groups, place yourselves in groups.
Little gray coats, little gray coats. Coo-oo,
coo-oo."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>So they went on, and it will be the same a
thousand years hence.</p>

<p>The sparrows feasted bravely and listened
attentively; they even stood in ranks like the
pigeons, but it did not suit them. So having
satisfied their hunger, they left the pigeons passing
their own opinions upon them to each other
and slipped through the garden railings. The door
of a room in the house, leading into the garden,
stood open, and one of them, feeling brave after
his good dinner, hopped upon the threshold crying,
"Tweet, I can venture so far."</p>

<p>"Tweet," said another, "I can venture that,
and a great deal more," and into the room he
hopped.</p>

<p>The first followed, and, seeing no one there, the
third became courageous and flew right across
the room, saying: "Venture everything, or do not
venture at all. This is a wonderful place&mdash;a man's
nest, I suppose; and look! what can this be?"</p>

<p>Just in front of the sparrows stood the ruins of
the burned cottage; roses were blooming over it,
and their reflection appeared in the water beneath,
and the black, charred beams rested against the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
tottering chimney. How could it be? How came
the cottage and the roses in a room in the nobleman's
house? And then the sparrows tried to
fly over the roses and the chimney, but they only
struck themselves against a flat wall. It was a
picture&mdash;a large, beautiful picture which the
artist had painted from the little sketch he had
made.</p>

<p>"Tweet," said the sparrows, "it is really nothing,
after all; it only looks like reality. Tweet, I
suppose that is <i>the beautiful</i>. Can you understand
it? I cannot."</p>

<p>Then some persons entered the room and the
sparrows flew away. Days and years passed. The
pigeons had often "coo-oo-d"&mdash;we must not say
quarreled, though perhaps they did, the naughty
things! The sparrows had suffered from cold in
the winter and lived gloriously in summer. They
were all betrothed, or married, or whatever you
like to call it. They had little ones, and each considered
its own brood the wisest and the prettiest.</p>

<p>One flew in this direction and another in that,
and when they met they recognized each other by
saying "tweet" and three times drawing back the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
left foot. The eldest remained single; she had no
nest nor young ones. Her great wish was to see
a large town, so she flew to Copenhagen.</p>

<p>Close by the castle, and by the canal, in which
swam many ships laden with apples and pottery,
there was to be seen a great house. The windows
were broader below than at the top, and when
the sparrows peeped through they saw a room
that looked to them like a tulip with beautiful
colors of every shade. Within the tulip were
white figures of human beings, made of marble&mdash;some
few of plaster, but this is the same thing
to a sparrow. Upon the roof stood a metal
chariot and horses, and the goddess of victory,
also of metal, was seated in the chariot driving
the horses.</p>

<p>It was Thorwaldsen's museum. "How it shines
and glitters," said the maiden sparrow. "This
must be <i>the beautiful</i>,&mdash;tweet,&mdash;only this is larger
than a peacock." She remembered what her
mother had told them in her childhood, that the
peacock was one of the greatest examples of <i>the
beautiful</i>. She flew down into the courtyard, where
everything also was very grand. The walls were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
painted to represent palm branches, and in the
midst of the court stood a large, blooming rose
tree, spreading its young, sweet, rose-covered
branches over a grave. Thither the maiden sparrow
flew, for she saw many others of her own
kind.</p>

<p>"Tweet," said she, drawing back her foot three
times. She had, during the years that had passed,
often made the usual greeting to the sparrows she
met, but without receiving any acknowledgment;
for friends who are once separated do not meet
every day. This manner of greeting was become
a habit to her, and to-day two old sparrows and
a young one returned the greeting.</p>

<p>"Tweet," they replied and drew back the left
foot three times. They were two old sparrows
out of the nest, and a young one belonging to the
family. "Ah, good day; how do you do? To
think of our meeting here! This is a very grand
place, but there is not much to eat; this is <i>the
beautiful</i>. Tweet!"</p>

<p>A great many people now came out of the side
rooms, in which the marble statues stood, and
approached the grave where rested the remains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
of the great master who carved them. As they
stood round Thorwaldsen's grave, each face had
a reflected glory, and some few gathered up the
fallen rose leaves to preserve them. They had all
come from afar; one from mighty England, others
from Germany and France. One very handsome
lady plucked a rose and concealed it in her bosom.
Then the sparrows thought that the roses ruled
in this place, and that the whole house had been
built for them&mdash;which seemed really too much
honor; but as all the people showed their love for
the roses, the sparrows thought they would not
remain behindhand in paying their respects.</p>

<p>"Tweet," they said, and swept the ground with
their tails, and glanced with one eye at the roses.
They had not looked at them very long, however,
before they felt convinced that they were old
acquaintances, and so they actually were. The
artist who had sketched the rosebush and the
ruins of the cottage had since then received permission
to transplant the bush and had given it
to the architect, for more beautiful roses had never
been seen. The architect had planted it on the
grave of Thorwaldsen, where it continued to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
bloom, the image of <i>the beautiful</i>, scattering its
fragrant, rosy leaves to be gathered and carried
away into distant lands in memory of the spot
on which they fell.</p>

<p>"Have you obtained a situation in town?" then
asked the sparrows of the roses.</p>

<p>The roses nodded. They recognized their little
brown neighbors and were rejoiced to see them
again.</p>

<p>"It is very delightful," said the roses, "to live
here and to blossom, to meet old friends, and to
see cheerful faces every day. It is as if each day
were a holiday."</p>

<p>"Tweet," said the sparrows to each other.
"Yes, these really are our old neighbors. We
remember their origin near the pond. Tweet! how
they have risen, to be sure. Some people seem
to get on while they are asleep. Ah! there's a
withered leaf. I can see it quite plainly."</p>

<p>And they pecked at the leaf till it fell, but
the rosebush continued fresher and greener than
ever. The roses bloomed in the sunshine on
Thorwaldsen's grave and thus became linked with
his immortal name.</p>

<h2>THE OLD HOUSE</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 101px;"><img src="images/drop-a.png" width="101" height="100" alt="A" title="" /></div><div class='unindent'> &nbsp; VERY old house once stood in a street
with several others that were quite new
and clean. One could read the date of
its erection, which had been carved on one of
the beams and surrounded by scrolls formed
of tulips and hop tendrils; by this date it could be
seen that the old house was nearly three hundred
years old. Entire verses too were written over the
windows in old-fashioned letters, and grotesque
faces, curiously carved, grinned at you from under
the cornices. One story projected a long way
over the other, and under the roof ran a leaden
gutter with a dragon's head at the end. The
rain was intended to pour out at the dragon's
mouth, but it ran out of his body instead, for there
was a hole in the gutter.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>All the other houses in the street were new
and well built, with large windowpanes and
smooth walls. Any one might see they had
nothing to do with the old house. Perhaps they
thought: "How long will that heap of rubbish
remain here, to be a disgrace to the whole street?
The parapet projects so far forward that no one
can see out of our windows what is going on in
that direction. The stairs are as broad as the
staircase of a castle and as steep as if they led
to a church tower. The iron railing looks like
the gate of a cemetery, and there are brass knobs
upon it. It is really too ridiculous."</p>

<p>Opposite to the old house were more nice
new houses, which had just the same opinion as
their neighbors.</p>

<p>At the window of one of them sat a little boy
with fresh, rosy cheeks and clear, sparkling eyes,
who was very fond of the old house in sunshine
or in moonlight. He would sit and look at the
wall, from which the plaster had in some places
fallen off, and fancy all sorts of scenes which had
been in former times&mdash;how the street must have
looked when the houses had all gable roofs, open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
staircases, and gutters with dragons at the spout.
He could even see soldiers walking about with
halberds. Certainly it was a very good house to
look at for amusement.</p>

<p>An old man lived in it who wore knee breeches,
a coat with large brass buttons, and a wig which
any one could see was a real one. Every morning
there came an old man to clean the rooms
and to wait upon him, otherwise the old man in
the knee breeches would have been quite alone
in the house. Sometimes he came to one of the
windows and looked out; then the little boy
nodded to him, and the old man nodded back
again, till they became acquainted, and were
friends, although they had never spoken to each
other; but that was of no consequence.</p>

<p>The little boy one day heard his parents say,
"The old man is very well off, but he must be
terribly lonely." So the next Sunday morning the
little boy wrapped something in a paper, and took
it to the door of the old house, and said to the
attendant who waited upon the old man: "Will
you please to give this from me to the gentleman
who lives here? I have two tin soldiers, and this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
is one of them, and he shall have it, because I
know he is terribly lonely."</p>

<p>The old attendant nodded and looked very
much pleased, and then he carried the tin soldier
into the house.</p>

<p>Afterwards he was sent over to ask the little
boy if he would not like to pay a visit himself.
His parents gave him permission, and so it was
that he gained admission to the old house.</p>

<p>The brass knobs on the railings shone more
brightly than ever, as if they had been polished
on account of his visit; and on the doors were
carved trumpeters standing in tulips, and it
seemed as if they were blowing with all their
might, their cheeks were so puffed out: "Tanta-ra-ra,
the little boy is coming. Tanta-ra-ra, the
little boy is coming."</p>

<p>Then the door opened. All round the hall hung
old portraits of knights in armor and ladies in silk
gowns; and the armor rattled, and the silk dresses
rustled. Then came a staircase which went up a
long way, and then came down a little way and led
to a balcony which was in a very ruinous state.
There were large holes and long cracks, out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
which grew grass and leaves; indeed the whole
balcony, the courtyard, and the walls were so overgrown
with green that they looked like a garden.</p>

<p>In the balcony stood flowerpots on which were
heads having asses' ears, but the flowers in them
grew just as they pleased. In one pot, pinks were
growing all over the sides,&mdash;at least the green
leaves were,&mdash;shooting forth stalk and stem and
saying as plainly as they could speak, "The air
has fanned me, the sun has kissed me, and I am
promised a little flower for next Sunday&mdash;really
for next Sunday!"</p>

<p>Then they entered a room in which the walls
were covered with leather, and the leather had
golden flowers stamped upon it.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Gilding wears out with time and bad weather,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But leather endures; there's nothing like leather,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>said the walls. Chairs handsomely carved, with
elbows on each side and with very high backs,
stood in the room; and as they creaked they
seemed to say: "Sit down. Oh dear! how I am
creaking; I shall certainly have the gout like
the old cupboard. Gout in my back, ugh!"</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>And then the little boy entered the room where
the old man sat.</p>

<p>"Thank you for the tin soldier, my little friend,"
said the old man, "and thank you also for coming
to see me."</p>

<p>"Thanks, thanks"&mdash;or "Creak, creak"&mdash;said
all the furniture.</p>

<p>There was so much furniture that the pieces
stood in each other's way to get a sight of the
little boy. On the wall near the center of the
room hung the picture of a beautiful lady, young
and gay, dressed in the fashion of the olden times,
with powdered hair and a full, stiff skirt. She
said neither "thanks" nor "creak," but she looked
down upon the little boy with her mild eyes, and
he said to the old man,</p>

<p>"Where did you get that picture?"</p>

<p>"From the shop opposite," he replied. "Many
portraits hang there. No one seems to know
any of them or to trouble himself about them.
The persons they represent have been dead and
buried long since. But I knew this lady many
years ago, and she has been dead nearly half
a century."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/p279i.png" width="336" height="500" alt="&quot;Thank you for the tin soldier, my little friend,&quot; said the old man...." title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>Under a glass beneath the picture hung a nosegay
of withered flowers, which were, no doubt, half
a century old too, at least they appeared so.</p>

<p>And the pendulum of the old clock went to
and fro, and the hands turned round, and as time
passed on everything in the room grew older,
but no one seemed to notice it.</p>

<p>"They say at home," said the little boy, "that
you are very lonely."</p>

<p>"Oh," replied the old man, "I have pleasant
thoughts of all that is past recalled by memory,
and now you too are come to visit me, and that
is very pleasant."</p>

<p>Then he took from the bookcase a book full
of pictures representing long processions of wonderful
coaches such as are never seen at the
present time, soldiers like the knave of clubs,
and citizens with waving banners. The tailors
had a flag with a pair of scissors supported by two
lions, and on the shoemakers' flag there were not
boots but an eagle with two heads, for the shoemakers
must have everything arranged so that
they can say, "This is a pair." What a picture
book it was! And then the old man went into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
another room to fetch apples and nuts. It was
very pleasant, certainly, to be in that old house.</p>

<p>"I cannot endure it," said the tin soldier, who
stood on a shelf; "it is so lonely and dull here.
I have been accustomed to live in a family, and
I cannot get used to this life. I cannot bear it.
The whole day is long enough, but the evening
is longer. It is not here as it was in your house
opposite, when your father and mother talked so
cheerfully together, while you and all the dear
children made such a delightful noise. Do you
think he gets any kisses? Do you think he ever
has friendly looks or a Christmas tree? He will
have nothing now but the grave. Oh! I cannot
bear it."</p>

<p>"You must not look on the sorrowful side so
much," said the little boy. "I think everything in
this house is beautiful, and all the old, pleasant
thoughts come back here to pay visits."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I never see any, and I don't know
them," said the tin soldier; "and I cannot bear it."</p>

<p>"You must bear it," said the little boy. Then
the old man came back with a pleasant face, and
brought with him beautiful preserved fruits as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
well as apples and nuts, and the little boy thought
no more of the tin soldier.</p>

<p>How happy and delighted the little boy was!
And after he returned home, and while days and
weeks passed, a great deal of nodding took place
from one house to the other, and then the little
boy went to pay another visit. The carved trumpeters
blew: "Tanta-ra-ra, there is the little boy.
Tanta-ra-ra." The swords and armor on the old
knights' pictures rattled, the silk dresses rustled,
the leather repeated its rhyme, and the old chairs
that had the gout in their backs cried "Creak";
it was all exactly like the first time, for in that
house one day and one hour were just like another.</p>

<p>"I cannot bear it any longer," said the tin
soldier; "I have wept tears of tin, it is so melancholy
here. Let me go to the wars and lose an
arm or a leg; that would be some change. I cannot
bear it. Now I know what it is to have visits
from one's old recollections and all they bring with
them. I have had visits from mine, and you may
believe me it is not altogether pleasant. I was very
nearly jumping from the shelf. I saw you all in
your house opposite, as if you were really present.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was Sunday morning, and you children
stood round the table, singing the hymn that
you sing every morning. You were standing
quietly with your hands folded, and your father
and mother were looking just as serious, when
the door opened, and your little sister Maria, who
is not two years old, was brought into the room.
You know she always dances when she hears
music and singing of any sort, so she began to
dance immediately, although she ought not to
have done so; but she could not get into the right
time because the tune was so slow, so she stood
first on one foot and then on the other and bent
her head very low, but it would not suit the
music. You all stood looking grave, although it
was very difficult to do so, but I laughed so to
myself that I fell down from the table and got
a bruise, which is still there. I know it was not
right to laugh. So all this, and everything else
that I have seen, keeps running in my head, and
these must be the old recollections that bring so
many thoughts with them. Tell me whether you
still sing on Sundays, and tell me about your
little sister Maria, and how my old comrade is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the other tin soldier. Ah, really he must be very
happy. I cannot endure this life."</p>

<p>"You are given away," said the little boy;
"you must stay. Don't you see that?" Then
the old man came in with a box containing
many curious things to show him. Rouge-pots,
scent-boxes, and old cards so large and so richly
gilded that none are ever seen like them in these
days. And there were smaller boxes to look at,
and the piano was opened, and inside the lid were
painted landscapes. But when the old man played,
the piano sounded quite out of tune. Then he
looked at the picture he had bought at the broker's,
and his eyes sparkled brightly as he nodded at it
and said, "Ah, she could sing that tune."</p>

<p>"I will go to the wars! I will go to the
wars!" cried the tin soldier as loud as he could,
and threw himself down on the floor. Where
could he have fallen? The old man searched,
and the little boy searched, but he was gone and
could not be found. "I shall find him again,"
said the old man. But he did not find him; the
tin soldier had fallen through a crack between the
boards and lay there now as in an open grave.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>The day went by, and the little boy returned
home; the week passed, and many more weeks.
It was winter, and the windows were quite frozen,
so that the little boy was obliged to breathe on
the panes and rub a hole to peep through at
the old house. Snowdrifts were lying in all the
scrolls and on the inscriptions, and the steps were
covered with snow as if no one were at home.
And indeed nobody was at home, for the old
man was dead.</p>

<p>In the evening the old man was to be taken to
the country to be buried there in his own grave;
so they carried him away. No one followed him,
for all his friends were dead, and the little boy
kissed his hand to his old friend as he saw him
borne away.</p>

<p>A few days after, there was an auction at the
old house, and from his window the little boy saw
the people carrying away the pictures of old
knights and ladies, the flowerpots with the long
ears, the old chairs, and the cupboards. Some
were taken one way, some another. <i>Her</i> portrait,
which had been bought at the picture dealer's,
went back again to his shop, and there it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
remained, for no one seemed to know her or
to care for the old picture.</p>

<p>In the spring they began to pull the house itself
down; people called it complete rubbish. From
the street could be seen the room in which the
walls were covered with leather, ragged and torn,
and the green in the balcony hung straggling over
the beams; they pulled it down quickly, for it
looked ready to fall, and at last it was cleared away
altogether. "What a good riddance," said the
neighbors' houses.</p>

<p>Afterward a fine new house was built, farther
back from the road. It had lofty windows and
smooth walls, but in front, on the spot where the old
house really stood, a little garden was planted, and
wild vines grew up over the neighboring walls. In
front of the garden were large iron railings and a
great gate which looked very stately. People used
to stop and peep through the railings. The sparrows
assembled in dozens upon the wild vines
and chattered all together as loud as they could,
but not about the old house. None of them could
remember it, for many years had passed by; so
many, indeed, that the little boy was now a man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
and a really good man too, and his parents were
very proud of him. He had just married and had
come with his young wife to reside in the new
house with the garden in front of it, and now he
stood there by her side while she planted a field
flower that she thought very pretty. She was
planting it herself with her little hands and pressing
down the earth with her fingers. "Oh, dear,
what was that?" she exclaimed as something
pricked her. Out of the soft earth something
was sticking up.</p>

<p>It was&mdash;only think!&mdash;it was really the tin
soldier, the very same which had been lost up in
the old man's room and had been hidden among
old wood and rubbish for a long time till it sank
into the earth, where it must have been for many
years. And the young wife wiped the soldier, first
with a green leaf and then with her fine pocket
handkerchief, that smelt of a beautiful perfume.
And the tin soldier felt as if he were recovering
from a fainting fit.</p>

<p>"Let me see him," said the young man, and
then he smiled and shook his head and said, "It
can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
something that happened to one of my tin soldiers
when I was a little boy." And then he told his
wife about the old house and the old man and of
the tin soldier which he had sent across because
he thought the old man was lonely. And he
related the story so clearly that tears came into
the eyes of the young wife for the old house and
the old man.</p>

<p>"It is very likely that this is really the same
soldier," said she, "and I will take care of him
and always remember what you have told me;
but some day you must show me the old man's
grave."</p>

<p>"I don't know where it is," he replied; "no
one knows. All his friends are dead. No one
took care of him or tended his grave, and I was
only a little boy."</p>

<p>"Oh, how dreadfully lonely he must have been,"
said she.</p>

<p>"Yes, terribly lonely," cried the tin soldier;
"still it is delightful not to be forgotten."</p>

<p>"Delightful indeed!" cried a voice quite near to
them. No one but the tin soldier saw that it came
from a rag of the leather which hung in tatters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
It had lost all its gilding and looked like wet
earth, but it had an opinion, and it spoke it
thus:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Gilding wears out with time and bad weather,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But leather endures; there's nothing like leather."</span><br />
</div>

<p>But the tin soldier did not believe any such
thing.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/p290i.png" width="400" height="196" alt="The Conceited Apple Branch" title="" />
</div>


<h2>THE CONCEITED APPLE BRANCH</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 38px;"><img src="images/drop-i.png" width="38" height="100" alt="I" title="" /></div><div class='unindent'>T WAS the month of May. The wind still
blew cold, but from bush and tree, field and
flower, came the welcome sound, "Spring is
come."</div>

<p>Wild flowers in profusion covered the hedges.
Under the little apple tree Spring seemed busy,
and he told his tale from one of the branches,
which hung fresh and blooming and covered
with delicate pink blossoms that were just ready
to open.</p>

<p>The branch well knew how beautiful it was;
this knowledge exists as much in the leaf as in
the blood. I was therefore not surprised when
a nobleman's carriage, in which sat the young
countess, stopped in the road just by. The apple
branch, she said, was a most lovely object, an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
emblem of spring in its most charming aspect.
The branch was broken off for her, and she held
it in her delicate hand and sheltered it with her
silk parasol.</p>

<p>Then they drove to the castle, in which were
lofty halls and splendid drawing-rooms. Pure
white curtains fluttered before the open windows,
and beautiful flowers stood in transparent vases.
In one of them, which looked as if it had been
cut out of newly fallen snow, the apple branch
was placed among some fresh light twigs of
beech. It was a charming sight. And the branch
became proud, which was very much like human
nature.</p>

<p>People of every description entered the room,
and according to their position in society so dared
they to express their admiration. Some few said
nothing, others expressed too much, and the apple
branch very soon got to understand that there was
as much difference in the characters of human
beings as in those of plants and flowers. Some are
all for pomp and parade, others have a great deal
to do to maintain their own importance, while the
rest might be spared without much loss to society.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
So thought the apple branch as he stood before
the open window, from which he could see out
over gardens and fields, where there were flowers
and plants enough for him to think and reflect
upon&mdash;some rich and beautiful, some poor and
humble indeed.</p>

<p>"Poor despised herbs," said the apple branch;
"there is really a difference between them and
such as I am. How unhappy they must be if they
can feel as those in my position do! There is a
difference indeed, and so there ought to be, or
we should all be equals."</p>

<p>And the apple branch looked with a sort of pity
upon them, especially on a certain little flower
that is found in fields and in ditches. No one
bound these flowers together in a nosegay, they
were too common,&mdash;they were even known to
grow between the paving stones, shooting up
everywhere like bad weeds,&mdash;and they bore the
very ugly name of "dog flowers," or "dandelions."</p>

<p>"Poor despised plants," said the apple bough,
"it is not your fault that you are so ugly and that
you have such an ugly name, but it is with plants
as with men&mdash;there must be a difference."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"A difference!" cried the sunbeam as he
kissed the blooming apple branch and then kissed
the yellow dandelion out in the fields. All were
brothers, and the sunbeam kissed them&mdash;the
poor flowers as well as the rich.</p>

<p>The apple bough had never thought of the
boundless love of God which extends over all the
works of creation, over everything which lives
and moves and has its being in Him. He had
never thought of the good and beautiful which are
so often hidden, but can never remain forgotten
by Him, not only among the lower creation, but
also among men. The sunbeam, the ray of light,
knew better.</p>

<p>"You do not see very far nor very clearly," he
said to the apple branch. "Which is the despised
plant you so specially pity?"</p>

<p>"The dandelion," he replied. "No one ever
places it in a nosegay; it is trodden under foot,
there are so many of them; and when they run to
seed they have flowers like wool, which fly away
in little pieces over the roads and cling to the
dresses of the people; they are only weeds&mdash;but
of course there must be weeds. Oh, I am really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
very thankful that I was not made like one of
these flowers."</p>

<p>There came presently across the fields a whole
group of children, the youngest of whom was so
small that he had to be carried by the others; and
when he was seated on the grass, among the yellow
flowers, he laughed aloud with joy, kicked out
his little legs, rolled about, plucked the yellow
flowers and kissed them in childlike innocence.</p>

<p>The elder children broke off the flowers with
long stems, bent the stalks one round the other to
form links, and made first a chain for the neck,
then one to go across the shoulders and hang
down to the waist, and at last a wreath to wear
about the head; so that they looked quite splendid
in their garlands of green stems and golden flowers.
But the eldest among them gathered carefully
the faded flowers, on the stem of which were
grouped together the seeds, in the form of a white,
feathery coronal.</p>

<p>These loose, airy wool-flowers are very beautiful,
and look like fine, snowy feathers or down. The
children held them to their mouths and tried to
blow away the whole coronal with one puff of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the breath. They had been told by their grandmothers
that whoever did so would be sure to have
new clothes before the end of the year. The despised
flower was by this raised to the position
of a prophet, or foreteller of events.</p>

<p>"Do you see," said the sunbeam, "do you see
the beauty of these flowers? Do you see their
powers of giving pleasure?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to children," said the apple bough.</p>

<p>By and by an old woman came into the field
and, with a blunt knife without a handle, began
to dig round the roots of some of the dandelion
plants and pull them up. With some she intended
to make tea for herself, but the rest she
was going to sell to the chemist and obtain money.</p>

<p>"But beauty is of higher value than all this,"
said the apple-tree branch; "only the chosen ones
can be admitted into the realms of the beautiful.
There is a difference between plants, just as there
is a difference between men."</p>

<p>Then the sunbeam spoke of the boundless love
of God as seen in creation and over all that lives,
and of the equal distribution of His gifts, both in
time and in eternity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is your opinion," said the apple bough.</p>

<p>Then some people came into the room and
among them the young countess&mdash;the lady who
had placed the apple bough in the transparent
vase, so pleasantly beneath the rays of sunlight.
She carried in her hand something that seemed
like a flower. The object was hidden by two or
three great leaves which covered it like a shield
so that no draft or gust of wind could injure it,
and it was carried more carefully than the apple
branch had ever been.</p>

<p>Very cautiously the large leaves were removed,
and there appeared the feathery seed crown of
the despised yellow dandelion. This was what the
lady had so carefully plucked and carried home
so safely covered, so that not one of the delicate
feathery arrows of which its mistlike shape was
so lightly formed should flutter away. She now
drew it forth quite uninjured and wondered at its
beautiful form, its airy lightness and singular construction
so soon to be blown away by the wind.</p>

<p>"See," she exclaimed, "how wonderfully God
has made this little flower. I will paint it in a
picture with the apple branch. Every one admires<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the beauty of the apple bough, but this humble
flower has been endowed by Heaven with another
kind of loveliness, and although they differ in
appearance both are children of the realms of
beauty."</p>

<p>Then the sunbeam kissed both the lowly flower
and the blooming apple branch, upon whose leaves
appeared a rosy blush.</p>
